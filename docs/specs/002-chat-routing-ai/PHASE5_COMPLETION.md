## Architecture & Design

### Data Flow

```
User Query ("How can we reduce dropout by 20%?")
    ↓
Classifier (PROBLEM_SOLVING detected, confidence: 0.85)
    ↓
AIRouter (Routes to ProblemSolvingAgent)
    ↓
ProblemSolvingAgent.process()
    ├─ Build analysis prompt with benchmarks
    ├─ Call Claude 3.5 Sonnet (async, 2s timeout)
    ├─ Extract and format response
    └─ Return AgentResponse with metadata
    ↓
Response (Analysis with 6 sections, latency: 450ms, confidence: 0.87)
```

### Agent Lifecycle

```
Initialize
  ├─ Load Anthropic client
  ├─ Load industry benchmarks
  └─ Validate configuration

Process Request
  ├─ Validate request (min 20 chars, contains problem indicators)
  ├─ Build structured prompt with benchmarks
  ├─ Call Claude API (with timeout)
  ├─ Estimate response quality/confidence
  └─ Return AgentResponse

Error Handling
  ├─ Timeout: Return fallback analysis (success=False)
  ├─ API Error: Return fallback analysis (success=False)
  └─ Validation Error: Return validation error (success=False)
```
