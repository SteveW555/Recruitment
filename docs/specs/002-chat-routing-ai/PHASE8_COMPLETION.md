## Implementation Details

### Agent: GeneralChatAgent

**File**: `utils/ai_router/agents/general_chat_agent.py`

#### Key Features

1. **Greeting Recognition & Response**
   - Detects common greetings (hello, hi, hey, good morning, etc.)
   - Responds with friendly, contextual replies
   - Includes recruitment context in responses

2. **Casual Conversation**
   - Handles social questions (how are you, what's up, etc.)
   - Friendly, conversational tone (temperature: 0.7)
   - Brief responses appropriate for non-business chat

3. **Off-Topic Query Handling**
   - Gracefully handles non-recruitment questions
   - Acknowledges limitations (weather, general knowledge)
   - Suggests relevant recruitment topics
   - Maintains helpful, non-dismissive tone

4. **Humor Support**
   - Can tell jokes on request
   - Recruitment-themed humor
   - Keeps engagement light and friendly

5. **Fallback Mode**
   - Detects when called as fallback agent
   - Acknowledges previous agent failure
   - Offers alternative assistance
   - Encourages rephrasing or more specific questions

6. **LLM Configuration**
   - **Provider**: Groq
   - **Model**: llama-3-70b-8192
   - **Timeout**: 2 seconds
   - **Max Tokens**: 300
   - **Temperature**: 0.7 (friendly, conversational)
   - **Response Format**: Natural language, brief

7. **Error Handling**
   - Timeout protection: 2s timeout with asyncio.wait_for
   - API failure fallback: Returns templated friendly response
   - Graceful degradation: Always returns valid AgentResponse
   - Validation: Accepts any non-empty query

#### Example Queries

```json
"example_queries": [
  "Hello",
  "Hi there",
  "How are you?",
  "Good morning",
  "Tell me a joke",

## Architecture & Design

### Data Flow

```
User Query ("Hello" or "Tell me a joke")
    ↓
Classifier (GENERAL_CHAT detected, confidence: varies)
    ↓
AIRouter (Routes to GeneralChatAgent)
    ↓
GeneralChatAgent.process()
    ├─ Validate request (any non-empty query)
    ├─ Check for fallback metadata
    ├─ Build appropriate prompt
    ├─ Call Groq API (async, 2s timeout)
    └─ Return AgentResponse with metadata
    ↓
Response (Friendly reply, latency: 100-300ms, fallback: false)
```

### Agent Lifecycle

```
Initialize
  ├─ Load Groq client
  └─ Validate configuration

Process Request
  ├─ Validate request (non-empty)
  ├─ Check if fallback scenario
  ├─ Build appropriate prompt (greeting, off-topic, or fallback)
  ├─ Call Groq API (with timeout)
  └─ Return AgentResponse

Error Handling
  ├─ Timeout: Return templated friendly response
  ├─ API Error: Return templated friendly response
  └─ Returns fallback response if necessary
```

### Modular Design

- ✅ Inherits from BaseAgent (abstract contract)
- ✅ Implements process() async method
- ✅ Implements get_category() method
- ✅ Respects timeout configuration
- ✅ Handles all exceptions gracefully
- ✅ Returns structured AgentResponse
- ✅ Includes metadata (latency, fallback flag)

---

## Fallback Strategy

### When General Chat Becomes Fallback

1. **Agent Timeout**: Another agent exceeded 2s timeout
   - Router catches TimeoutError
   - Invokes General Chat with fallback=True
   - Returns friendly error message

2. **Agent Failure**: Another agent raised exception
   - Router catches Exception
   - Invokes General Chat with fallback=True
   - Returns helpful alternative suggestion

3. **Low Confidence**: Router confidence <70% for all categories
   - Routes to General Chat
   - Asks user to clarify
   - Suggests specific topic categories

### Fallback Response Pattern

```
"I apologize, but I encountered an issue with that request.
Could you try rephrasing or asking about something more specific?
I'm here to help!"
```
