## Architecture & Design

### Data Flow

```
User Query ("Create a quarterly performance report...")
    ↓
Classifier (REPORT_GENERATION detected, confidence: 0.78)
    ↓
AIRouter (Routes to ReportGenerationAgent)
    ↓
ReportGenerationAgent.process()
    ├─ Validate request (contains report indicators)
    ├─ Build report generation prompt
    ├─ Call Groq API (async, 2s timeout)
    ├─ Check for visualizations
    ├─ Format as markdown
    └─ Return AgentResponse with metadata
    ↓
Response (Report content, latency: 420ms, presentation_ready: true)
```

### Agent Lifecycle

```
Initialize
  ├─ Load Groq client
  ├─ Load report templates
  ├─ Load visualization patterns
  └─ Validate configuration

Process Request
  ├─ Validate request (contains report indicators)
  ├─ Build report generation prompt
  ├─ Call Groq API (with timeout)
  ├─ Check for visualizations in output
  ├─ Set presentation_ready flag
  └─ Return AgentResponse

Error Handling
  ├─ Timeout: Return fallback report (success=False)
  ├─ API Error: Return fallback report (success=False)
  └─ Validation Error: Return validation error (success=False)
```

### Modular Design

- ✅ Inherits from BaseAgent (abstract contract)
- ✅ Implements process() async method
- ✅ Implements get_category() method
- ✅ Respects timeout configuration
- ✅ Handles all exceptions gracefully
- ✅ Returns structured AgentResponse
- ✅ Includes rich metadata (latency, report_format, presentation_ready, includes_visualizations)

- **Also Consider**: Bar chart (if discrete periods), Combination chart (trend + actuals)

### For Comparisons
- **Primary**: Bar chart (horizontal or vertical)
- **Alternative**: Grouped bar chart (multiple comparisons)
- **Also Consider**: Box plot (distribution), Radar chart (many dimensions)

### For Composition
- **Primary**: Pie chart (simple, clear breakdown)
- **Alternative**: Donut chart (variation), Stacked bar chart (multiple compositions)
- **Also Consider**: Treemap (hierarchical breakdown)

### For Distribution
- **Primary**: Histogram (frequency distribution)
- **Alternative**: Box plot (quartiles and outliers)
- **Also Consider**: Scatter plot (with density), Violin plot (shape and density)
