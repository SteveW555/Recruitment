## Candidate Types Guide:

Candidates: This is our general all-purpose term for anyone in our database, whether they applied for a specific job or role or not.

Applicants: These are candidates who have applied for a specific job. We’ll refer to them as “applicants” when we’re talking about a particular role.

Talent Pool Candidates: These are candidates who’ve explicitly said they’d like to be considered for future opportunities. We’ll call them our “talent pool” or “pipeline” candidates.
