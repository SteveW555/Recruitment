# Bullhorn Integration Capabilities and API Overview

## Bullhorn API Features and Endpoints

**Supported Data Entities:** Bullhorn’s REST API exposes all core record types in the ATS/CRM. The five primary entity categories are **Candidates**, **Contacts** (ClientContact for client/hiring-manager contacts), **Companies** (ClientCorporation records), **Job Orders** (job openings), and **Placements** (filled jobs)[\[1\]](https://kb.bullhorn.com/ats/Content/BHATS/Topics/BHDataEntityRelationships.htm#:~:text=Understanding%20Bullhorn%20Entities). These represent the key data objects of a recruitment workflow. In addition, the API covers related entities such as **Job Submissions** (candidate applications to jobs), **Notes** (comments/activities on records), **Tasks/Appointments** (schedule entries), **Leads/Opportunities** (sales pipeline records), **CorporateUser** (internal users), and more. For example, a **Note** in Bullhorn is a comment that can be attached to a Candidate, Contact, Job, Placement, etc., and is visible on the “Notes” tab of those records[\[2\]](https://bullhorn.github.io/rest-api-docs/entityref.html#:~:text=Represents%20a%20note%20,record%20in%20the%20Bullhorn%20application). Virtually every piece of Bullhorn data – including custom fields and **file attachments** (e.g. resumes) – is accessible as an entity via the API.

**Key API Endpoints and Operations:** Bullhorn’s REST API is organized around a few main endpoint patterns for data access and manipulation[\[3\]](https://bullhorn.github.io/rest-api-docs/#:~:text=query%2C%20and%20meta,some%20common%20parameters%20and%20behavior):

* **/entity/{EntityType}** – for CRUD operations on individual records. Supports GET (retrieve by ID), PUT (update), POST (create), and DELETE (delete) on entities like Candidate, JobOrder, etc[\[4\]](https://bullhorn.github.io/rest-api-docs/#:~:text=,metadata%20data%20that%20describes%20the). For example, GET …/entity/Candidate/{id}?fields=... retrieves a candidate by ID, and PUT …/entity/Candidate/{id} updates a candidate’s fields.

* **/search/{EntityType}** – performs keyword searches against a Lucene index of records, useful for text queries (e.g. search candidates by skills or name). It returns lists of IDs matching the criteria[\[4\]](https://bullhorn.github.io/rest-api-docs/#:~:text=,metadata%20data%20that%20describes%20the).

* **/query/{EntityType}** – performs structured queries using a SQL-like JPQL syntax. This allows filtering by field values (e.g. all jobs where status \= “Open”) and returns record IDs[\[5\]](https://bullhorn.github.io/rest-api-docs/#:~:text=query%20parameters%20to%20return%20data,return%20entity%20metadata%20on%20any).

* **/meta/{EntityType}** – returns metadata about an entity’s fields (field names, types, etc.), or can be appended to any GET to describe the structure of returned data[\[6\]](https://bullhorn.github.io/rest-api-docs/#:~:text=,return%20entity%20metadata%20on%20any).

* **File APIs:** Separate endpoints exist for file content, such as …/entity/Candidate/{id}/fileAttachments to list or upload file attachments on a candidate[\[7\]](https://www.getknit.dev/blog/bullhorn-api-directory-DlpbVe#:~:text=,Linked%20to%20a%20Candidate%20Application), and /entity/…/file or /userFile endpoints to download files like resumes. There are also specialized endpoints for profile photos (headshots) on Candidate or Contact records[\[8\]](https://bullhorn.github.io/rest-api-docs/#:~:text=Returns%20a%20user%20headshot%20,the%20following%20types%20of%20entities)[\[9\]](https://bullhorn.github.io/rest-api-docs/#:~:text=,CorporateUser).

**Authentication and Authorization:** All access to the Bullhorn REST API is secured via **OAuth 2.0** and session tokens. An integration must first obtain OAuth credentials (a **Client ID** and **Client Secret**) by registering the application with Bullhorn support[\[10\]](https://www.getknit.dev/blog/bullhorn-api-directory-DlpbVe#:~:text=How%20do%20I%20get%20started,with%20the%20Bullhorn%20REST%20API)[\[11\]](https://www.getknit.dev/blog/bullhorn-api-directory-DlpbVe#:~:text=What%20authentication%20method%20does%20the,Bullhorn%20API%20use). Using these, the integration performs the OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow to get an access token. **Next, a login API call** is made to Bullhorn’s REST login service with that access token, which yields a **BhRestToken** (Bullhorn REST session token) and a base API URL for that specific Bullhorn cluster/user[\[12\]](https://bullhorn.github.io/rest-api-docs/#:~:text=1,cookie%2C%20or%20an%20HTTP%20header)[\[13\]](https://bullhorn.github.io/rest-api-docs/#:~:text=2,API%20requests%20must%20be%20prefixed). The BhRestToken is a short-lived session key that must accompany all subsequent requests (as a query param, header, or cookie)[\[14\]](https://bullhorn.github.io/rest-api-docs/#:~:text=The%20REST%20API%20has%20the,calls%20without%20having%20to%20authenticate)[\[15\]](https://bullhorn.github.io/rest-api-docs/#:~:text=1,based%20clients). The token maintains an API session on behalf of a specific Bullhorn user. In practice, the integration will store this token temporarily and refresh it (by re-authenticating) when expired. Bullhorn provides a **“loginInfo”** endpoint to discover the correct datacenter base URL for a given user, which helps route API calls to the right server[\[16\]](https://bullhorn.github.io/rest-api-docs/#:~:text=API%20users%20should%20use%20data,services%2FloginInfo%3Fusername%3D%7BAPI_Username)[\[17\]](https://bullhorn.github.io/rest-api-docs/#:~:text=All%20URLs%20are%20namespaced%20by,For%20example).

**Webhook and Event Capabilities:** Bullhorn’s API supports **event subscriptions** to capture data changes in near-real-time. Rather than true push webhooks, Bullhorn uses a publish/subscribe model where the client registers an event subscription and then polls for events. The integration can **subscribe to entity events** (INSERTED, UPDATED, DELETED) on specific record types (e.g. Candidate, JobOrder, Placement, Note, etc.) by calling PUT /event/subscription/{subscriptionId}?type=entity\&names={EntityList}\&eventTypes=...[\[18\]](https://bullhorn.github.io/rest-api-docs/#:~:text=curl%20,services%2Fe999%2Fevent%2Fsubscription%2FAbcde%3Ftype%3Dentity%26names%3DCandidate%20%26eventTypes%3DINSERTED%2CUPDATED%2CDELETED)[\[19\]](https://bullhorn.github.io/rest-api-docs/#:~:text=Parameter%20Required%20Description%20type%20yes,cookie%2C%20or%20an%20HTTP%20header). Once subscribed, the client can **poll** GET /event/subscription/{subscriptionId} to retrieve a batch of event notifications (up to a specified maxEvents) with details of what changed[\[20\]](https://bullhorn.github.io/rest-api-docs/#:~:text=GET%20%2Fevent%2Fsubscription)[\[21\]](https://bullhorn.github.io/rest-api-docs/#:~:text=%22eventId%22%3A%20%22ID%3AJBM,UPDATED). Each event payload includes the entity type, entity ID, the event type (e.g. “UPDATED”), timestamp, and even which fields were changed in an update[\[22\]](https://bullhorn.github.io/rest-api-docs/#:~:text=%7B%20%22eventId%22%3A%20%22ID%3AJBM,29b91fcb703d%22%20%7D%2C%20%22entityName%22%3A%20%22ClientContact)[\[23\]](https://bullhorn.github.io/rest-api-docs/#:~:text=,%5D%20%7D). This mechanism allows an external system to detect new or modified records in Bullhorn and sync them. Bullhorn retains events for a limited time (unretrieved events expire after \~7 days by default)[\[24\]](https://kb.bullhorn.com/ats/Content/BHATS/Topics/understandingBHAPIUsageLimitsVersioningBackwardCompatibility.htm#:~:text=responsible%20for%20creating%20that%20edit,in%20use%20by%20your%20company)[\[25\]](https://kb.bullhorn.com/ats/Content/BHATS/Topics/understandingBHAPIUsageLimitsVersioningBackwardCompatibility.htm#:~:text=,unretrieved%20events%20is%20seven%20days), so the integration should poll regularly. It’s important to note that **Bullhorn does not natively do outbound webhooks** to external URLs without additional tooling – as of recent information, there is no built-in push webhook support[\[26\]](https://www.getknit.dev/blog/bullhorn-api-directory-DlpbVe#:~:text=Does%20the%20Bullhorn%20API%20support,time%20data%20updates). However, Bullhorn’s Automation tools (formerly “Herefish”) do allow configured webhook steps for certain triggers in the UI[\[27\]](https://bullhorn.github.io/rest-api-docs/#:~:text=API%20Reference%20,operation%20and%20supported%20entity%20type). In general, expect to use the event subscription \+ polling approach for “real-time” updates, or fall back to periodic polling of the /search or /query endpoints (e.g. querying for records where dateLastModified is recent).

## Integration Opportunities with Bullhorn (Enhancing Value)

Integrating a third-party **Universal Recruitment Automation System** with Bullhorn unlocks many possibilities to augment a recruiting team’s efficiency and insights. Below are key integration opportunities and how they add value for a Bullhorn-using recruitment company:

* **Unified Dashboards & Analytics:** Pull data from Bullhorn (candidates, jobs, placements, activities) into the automation system’s dashboards to provide enriched analytics. For example, an integration can aggregate data on placements, pipeline velocity, recruiter activities, and revenue, beyond what Bullhorn’s native reports offer. By combining Bullhorn data with other sources (e.g. HR or finance systems), the platform can display comprehensive **KPIs** and trends (time-to-fill, source performance, placement ROI) in one place. The Bullhorn API supports such reporting use-cases by allowing bulk queries on entities like JobOrder or Placement[\[28\]](https://www.getknit.dev/blog/bullhorn-api-directory-DlpbVe#:~:text=,Retrieve%20List%20of%20Job%20Orders)[\[29\]](https://www.getknit.dev/blog/bullhorn-api-directory-DlpbVe#:~:text=Are%20there%20rate%20limits%20for,the%20Bullhorn%20API). This gives managers deeper insight into operations, helping them make data-driven decisions.

* **Candidate Insights and AI Matching:** Enhance candidate profiles with intelligence from the automation system. The integration can fetch **Candidate** records (education, skills, work history, notes) via API and apply AI models (for skill extraction, scoring, or matching algorithms). The system might generate a “match score” between candidates and open jobs or highlight key insights (e.g. flags if a candidate’s resume matches a new job posting). These insights can be fed back into Bullhorn – for instance by adding **Notes or custom fields** to the Candidate or Job records with AI-generated commentary. Bullhorn’s API allows creating Note records attached to entities (e.g. a note on a candidate with the latest AI screening summary)[\[2\]](https://bullhorn.github.io/rest-api-docs/entityref.html#:~:text=Represents%20a%20note%20,record%20in%20the%20Bullhorn%20application)[\[30\]](https://bullhorn.github.io/rest-api-docs/entityref.html#:~:text=id%20Integer%20Id%20of%20this,X). This adds value by giving recruiters using Bullhorn additional context (like AI-recommended candidates for a job, or an automated qualification score) directly within their ATS.

* **Job Data Synchronization & Multi-Channel Posting:** Using Bullhorn’s job endpoints, the integration can sync job postings between Bullhorn and external systems. For example, whenever a **JobOrder** is added or updated in Bullhorn, the integration (via event subscription or scheduled checks) can pick it up and automatically post the job to external job boards or the company’s website. Conversely, if the automation platform has a job distribution module (or a central job board), it can push new jobs into Bullhorn via the API so everything stays in sync. This ensures a single source of truth for job data. The **most common use of the Bullhorn API is indeed to power custom job boards** on company websites[\[31\]](https://kb.bullhorn.com/ats/Content/BHATS/Topics/customizingBHWithThirdPartySolutions.htm#:~:text=The%20Bullhorn%20API%20allows%20your,or%20deleting%20records%20as%20needed) – pulling job info from Bullhorn and enabling online applications, which are then **pushed back as Candidate records and Job Submissions** via the API. This bidirectional job sync saves recruiters time (no double entry) and expands the reach of their postings.

* **Automated Data Entry and Updates:** The integration can relieve recruiters of manual data entry by capturing certain activities in the external system and pushing them into Bullhorn. For instance, if the automation platform processes candidate emails or interview feedback, it could create corresponding **records in Bullhorn** (such as Notes for each email interaction, or updating a candidate’s status when they progress in the hiring process). Similarly, changes made in Bullhorn by recruiters (like moving a candidate to “Placed”) can trigger the external system to perform follow-up actions (e.g. send a survey or update a back-office system). By leveraging the **Bullhorn Events API**, the integration can listen for updates such as placement status changes[\[22\]](https://bullhorn.github.io/rest-api-docs/#:~:text=%7B%20%22eventId%22%3A%20%22ID%3AJBM,29b91fcb703d%22%20%7D%2C%20%22entityName%22%3A%20%22ClientContact)[\[32\]](https://bullhorn.github.io/rest-api-docs/#:~:text=,%5D%20%7D%20%5D) and respond accordingly, ensuring both systems stay synchronized and key events trigger automated workflows (emails, reminders, etc.).

* **Communication and Activity Logging:** Many recruiting teams use Bullhorn to log calls, emails, and notes about candidates and clients. An automation system could integrate with email or VoIP systems and then use Bullhorn’s API to log those communications automatically. For example, if a recruiter emails a candidate from outside Bullhorn, the integration could capture that email (via an email API) and then call Bullhorn’s API to insert a **Note** on the candidate’s record with the email content. This ensures Bullhorn remains the central hub of all candidate interactions. Similarly, phone call integrations (like CTI systems) use the API to create call notes in Bullhorn. (In fact, Bullhorn integrations like Tenfold do exactly this – on an incoming call, Tenfold queries Bullhorn for the contact and then writes a call note to Bullhorn when the call ends)[\[33\]](https://community.liveperson.com/kb/articles/1197-configure-the-tenfold-integration-for-bullhorn#:~:text=Bullhorn%20field%20permissions%20for%20the%C2%A0Tenfold%C2%A0integration). Automating activity logging means recruiters get a 360° view of client/candidate communications in Bullhorn without needing to manually input every touchpoint.

* **Workflow Automation & Talent Nurturing:** The integration platform can add value by automating routine workflows that involve Bullhorn data. For example, it might periodically query Bullhorn for candidates who haven’t been contacted in 60 days and then trigger an automated email campaign or update a “last contact” field. It could also auto-create follow-up **Tasks/Appointments** in Bullhorn (via the API’s Appointment or Task entities) for recruiters when certain conditions are met (e.g. a candidate reaches a certain stage). While Bullhorn has some automation (through Bullhorn Automation/HEREFISH), a custom integration can implement bespoke business rules. By pushing and pulling data via API – for instance, adding an Appointment record for an interview schedule or reading Tasks assigned to the integration user – the external system can seamlessly interact with Bullhorn’s workflow entities to keep everyone on track.

Each of these opportunities leverages Bullhorn’s API to either **pull data out** (for analysis, matching, or external use) or **push data in** (to log results, keep Bullhorn updated). In doing so, the recruitment company gains efficiency (through reduced manual work and real-time sync) and richer functionality than Bullhorn alone provides.

## Required Account Types and Permissions for API Access

Integrating with Bullhorn is not simply a matter of having credentials – the client’s Bullhorn edition and user permissions determine what the API can do. **Bullhorn API access must be enabled** on the client’s account. Notably, Bullhorn requires the customer to be on an appropriate edition (generally **Enterprise Edition**) to use the API for custom integrations[\[34\]](https://kb.bullhorn.com/ats/Content/BHATS/Topics/customizingBHWithThirdPartySolutions.htm#:~:text=can%20review%20the%20available%20functionality). If a client is on a lower-tier edition (Professional or Corporate editions), they may have limited or no API capabilities; Bullhorn’s documentation explicitly notes that using the API for custom applications requires Enterprise licensing[\[35\]](https://kb.bullhorn.com/ats/Content/BHATS/Topics/customizingBHWithThirdPartySolutions.htm#:~:text=Please%20note%20that%20if%20you,the%20Enterprise%20Edition%20of%20Bullhorn). It’s advisable to verify the client’s edition with their Bullhorn Account Manager or Support to ensure API access is available.

**API User vs Standard User:** Bullhorn integrations typically use a dedicated **API user account** (a service user) rather than a personal login. This is a Bullhorn user created specifically for the integration, with an **API password** and the necessary privileges. Many customers simply give this API user **administrator-level permissions** to avoid issues, since the integration might need to read or write across candidates, jobs, contacts, etc.[\[33\]](https://community.liveperson.com/kb/articles/1197-configure-the-tenfold-integration-for-bullhorn#:~:text=Bullhorn%20field%20permissions%20for%20the%C2%A0Tenfold%C2%A0integration). However, for security and compliance, it’s best to follow least privilege: configure the API user with all required entitlements and nothing extra. Bullhorn allows fine-grained permission settings per user. For example, an integration that only needs to read data might be granted *View* permissions on relevant entities without edit rights. On the other hand, a two-way integration that creates records will need *Add* and *Edit* permissions on those entities. According to Bullhorn integration guides, at minimum the API user often needs rights to **Add/Edit** candidates, jobs, clients, notes, etc., and view all records (including private candidates/contacts if relevant)[\[36\]\[37\]](https://community.liveperson.com/kb/articles/1197-configure-the-tenfold-integration-for-bullhorn#:~:text=Tenfold%C2%A0requires%20creating%20an%20API%20user,for%20the%C2%A0Tenfold%C2%A0core%20integration%20in%20Bullhorn). If certain API calls result in “403 Forbidden”, it usually means the user’s role lacks permission for that entity or field, and an admin must adjust the user’s security settings or request Bullhorn Support to enable that access[\[38\]](https://help.bullhorn.com/article/How-to-Edit-CorporateUser-via-API#:~:text=How%20to%20Edit%20CorporateUser%20via,All%20rights).

**Sandbox vs Production:** Bullhorn provides sandbox (test) environments to partners and clients for development. Ideally, the integration should be developed and tested against a **Bullhorn sandbox** – which is essentially a copy of a Bullhorn instance with test data – to avoid impacting real data during development. Members of Bullhorn’s Developer Partner Program are often given a fully functional **development instance of Bullhorn and a dedicated API key** for testing[\[39\]](https://www.bullhorn.com/news-and-press/press-releases/bullhorn-announces-developer-partner-program-open-source-portal-creating-open-ecosystem-partners-create-incredible-customer-experiences/#:~:text=,to%20API%20support%20and). If a sandbox isn’t available, some clients use their production environment with a test database segment, but this is less ideal. In either case, the OAuth **Client ID/Secret** obtained from Bullhorn can be set up for a sandbox or for production use. Typically, separate API credentials are used for sandbox vs. production (each with its own client ID/secret and redirect URI). The integration should also be configured for the correct Bullhorn **data center** (Bullhorn has multiple data centers – e.g. US, EU, etc. – the login workflow will provide the specific base URL to use[\[40\]](https://docs.matadorjobs.com/articles/connecting-to-bullhorn/#:~:text=The%20%E2%80%9CDatacenter%E2%80%9D%20Step)[\[41\]](https://docs.matadorjobs.com/articles/connecting-to-bullhorn/#:~:text=if%20you%20choose%20a%20data,North%20Carolina)). In summary, a **Bullhorn sandbox environment** is highly recommended for initial integration work[\[42\]](https://www.getknit.dev/blog/bullhorn-api-directory-DlpbVe#:~:text=,development%20without%20affecting%20live%20data), and the client’s API user should be created there first, then replicated or reconfigured for production once ready.

**Special Permissions and Considerations:** Some API functions might require higher privileges or specific modules enabled. For instance, to use the event subscription API, the API user must have permission to create subscriptions (this is generally covered if API access is enabled, as Bullhorn imposes a limit on number of subscriptions rather than a permission). Also, certain fields are considered “private” or confidential – by default, an API call might not return sensitive fields (like candidate salary, or confidential candidate details) unless the user has permission to view confidential fields[\[43\]](https://bullhorn.github.io/rest-api-docs/entityref.html#:~:text=Candidate%20confidential%20fields). Admin users by default see everything, whereas a standard user’s API calls might return "\*\*CONFIDENTIAL\*\*" for those fields[\[44\]](https://bullhorn.github.io/rest-api-docs/entityref.html#:~:text=Candidate). If the integration requires access to such data, ensure the API user is configured with the ability to view confidential fields or that the fields are not marked private in Bullhorn’s field settings. Finally, if the integration needs to **impersonate multiple users** or perform actions on behalf of different users, note that the Bullhorn API generally operates in the context of the logged-in user (the BhRestToken’s user). Most integrations stick to one service account that owns all actions (with notes or edits indicating that user in Bullhorn’s history). If more complex user-context is needed, it might require multiple API users or use of the “corporate user” entity to switch context, but that is advanced and typically not required.

## Integration Models: Pulling vs. Pushing Bullhorn Data

When architecting the integration, there are two broad models: **pulling data from Bullhorn** into the external system, and **pushing data from the external system** into Bullhorn. A robust integration will likely do both in a complementary fashion.

**Pull Model (Importing Bullhorn Data):** In this model, the Universal Automation System acts as a consumer of Bullhorn data, keeping itself updated with any changes made by recruiters in the Bullhorn app. The simplest approach is scheduled polling: for example, the system can run a job every 10 minutes to query Bullhorn for newly added or modified records. This can be done efficiently using the API’s query syntax (e.g. “find all candidates where dateLastModified \> lastSyncTime”) or via the event subscription feed. Using the **Event Subscription API**, the system can retrieve a list of recent changes since the last poll[\[45\]](https://bullhorn.github.io/rest-api-docs/#:~:text=,)[\[46\]](https://bullhorn.github.io/rest-api-docs/#:~:text=%22PERSON_ID%22%3A%20%221314%22%2C%20%22TRANSACTION_ID%22%3A%20%22c8d8f9ea,password). Each event tells which entity changed and its ID, so the system can then call the /entity endpoint to fetch the full record if needed. This pull model ensures the external system maintains a near-real-time mirror of relevant Bullhorn data (candidates, jobs, etc.). For example, if a recruiter edits a candidate’s contact info in Bullhorn, the next poll will catch an UPDATED event for that candidate[\[23\]](https://bullhorn.github.io/rest-api-docs/#:~:text=,%5D%20%7D) and the integration can pull the updated details to update its own database. Pulling data is also useful for initial data loads – e.g. importing all existing jobs and candidates from Bullhorn when first connecting a client’s account.

**Push Model (Exporting to Bullhorn):** The complementary side is pushing new or derived data into Bullhorn so that the ATS remains the central record system. Common push scenarios include: creating new records (or updating records) in Bullhorn based on external events, and adding notes or log entries to existing records. For instance, when the automation system identifies a new candidate (perhaps parsed from an email or entered through a chatbot), it can **create a Candidate via** POST /entity/Candidate and then perhaps **add a JobSubmission** if that candidate applied to a specific job. Similarly, if the external system is tracking something like interview feedback or assessment scores for candidates, those can be pushed into Bullhorn – either as **Notes** attached to the candidate, or by updating custom fields on the Candidate record (which is done via a PUT /entity/Candidate/{id} to set those fields). Pushing data requires careful mapping of the external data to Bullhorn’s structure (for example, ensuring that required fields are present when creating a new entity). The Bullhorn API will validate permissions and data formats on push; as long as the API user has rights, the data will be written to the client’s Bullhorn instance in real time.

**Integration Architecture Considerations:** A recommended model is to use a hybrid of **event-driven sync plus periodic reconciliation**. For near-immediate updates, configure event subscriptions on key entities (Candidate, JobOrder, Placement, etc.) so the system knows as soon as something changes in Bullhorn. Then, for each event, decide if action is needed (e.g. if a new Placement is created in Bullhorn, perhaps trigger a welcome email via the automation system). In the other direction, whenever the external system needs to make a change in Bullhorn, it should call the relevant API endpoint promptly (for example, when a user schedules an interview in an external calendar, the integration can create an Appointment in Bullhorn at that moment). It’s wise to build some throttling or queue for API calls to avoid hitting rate limits (see next section). Additionally, having a periodic full sync (perhaps nightly) where the system re-pulls all relevant data or a checksum of data can ensure no changes were missed, especially if an event was lost or an error occurred. Since Bullhorn’s API is stateless (aside from the session token), each API call is independent – the integration can be scaled horizontally if needed (just ensure each instance can obtain a token or share a token securely).

**Handling Conflicts:** In a two-way sync, conflicts can occur (e.g. a candidate edited in Bullhorn and also updated in the external system before the sync happens). It’s important to establish the source of truth per data type or field. In many cases, Bullhorn will be the source of truth for core candidate and client data, so the external system should generally not overwrite fields in Bullhorn unless it’s enriching data. If the integration does update Bullhorn records, implement logic to detect if the record was modified in Bullhorn in the interim (the dateLastModified timestamp can be used – the system can compare it to the last known timestamp to decide if it’s safe to push an update or if it should fetch the latest first). Bullhorn does not provide transaction locks via API, so conflict resolution is up to the integration’s design (e.g. last write wins, or field-by-field merge).

In summary, the user’s system will **initiate API calls** in both directions: pulling changes on a timer or via event polling, and pushing updates immediately when needed. This design ensures a tight integration where Bullhorn and the external platform remain in sync and the recruiters get the benefit of both systems without double data entry.

## Rate Limits, Licensing, and Compliance Considerations

When integrating with Bullhorn, one must account for usage limits and governance rules to maintain a stable and compliant integration:

* **API Rate Limits:** Bullhorn imposes API call limits to ensure fair use for all clients and to protect the performance of the cloud service[\[47\]](https://kb.bullhorn.com/ats/Content/BHATS/Topics/understandingBHAPIUsageLimitsVersioningBackwardCompatibility.htm#:~:text=Compatibility,imposing%20limits%20on%20the%20following). The limits depend on the edition of the Bullhorn subscription. For *Enterprise Edition* (full API access), the default limits are extremely high – up to **2,000,000 calls per day** and **1,500 calls per minute**, with up to 50 concurrent API sessions allowed[\[48\]](https://kb.bullhorn.com/ats/Content/BHATS/Topics/understandingBHAPIUsageLimitsVersioningBackwardCompatibility.htm#:~:text=Enterprise%20Edition%20,Access). For *Corporate Edition* (limited API access), the limits are lower – around **100,000 calls per day** and **700 calls per minute**, with 25 concurrent sessions[\[49\]](https://kb.bullhorn.com/ats/Content/BHATS/Topics/understandingBHAPIUsageLimitsVersioningBackwardCompatibility.htm#:~:text=Corporate%20Edition%20,Access). These numbers indicate that normal integration use (which might be a few thousand calls a day) is well within limits, but intensive data sync or bulk migrations need to be mindful of the caps. The API will return HTTP 429 “Too Many Requests” if the rate limit is exceeded[\[29\]](https://www.getknit.dev/blog/bullhorn-api-directory-DlpbVe#:~:text=Are%20there%20rate%20limits%20for,the%20Bullhorn%20API). The integration should implement error handling and backoff if it hits rate limits, and consider spreading out large data pulls over time. It’s also worth noting that Bullhorn’s limits include event polling and all calls across the client’s API users, so if multiple integrations or tools are in use, the total must stay under the threshold.

* **API Session Limits:** The session (BhRestToken) has a time-to-live (TTL) which by default might be around 10 minutes of inactivity, but the API login call allows specifying a TTL parameter to keep the session alive longer[\[50\]](https://bullhorn.github.io/rest-api-docs/#:~:text=curl%20https%3A%2F%2Frest.bullhornstaffing.com%2Flogin%3Faccess_token%3Dxxx%26version%3D). However, Bullhorn also limits how many concurrent sessions (logins) a company can have (e.g. 25 for Corporate, 50 for Enterprise[\[51\]](https://kb.bullhorn.com/ats/Content/BHATS/Topics/understandingBHAPIUsageLimitsVersioningBackwardCompatibility.htm#:~:text=,unretrieved%20events%20is%20seven%20days)[\[52\]](https://kb.bullhorn.com/ats/Content/BHATS/Topics/understandingBHAPIUsageLimitsVersioningBackwardCompatibility.htm#:~:text=,API%20Subscriptions%20allowed%20is%2015)). This means you shouldn’t constantly re-login for every single API call. The best practice is to obtain one session token and reuse it for as many calls as possible, refreshing only when necessary. Also, if building a multi-tenant product (serving many Bullhorn clients), each client’s credentials will yield their own token; avoid sharing one token across different client corp IDs.

* **Licensing and API Access Costs:** As mentioned, ensure the client has the correct Bullhorn edition (Enterprise) that includes API access[\[34\]](https://kb.bullhorn.com/ats/Content/BHATS/Topics/customizingBHWithThirdPartySolutions.htm#:~:text=can%20review%20the%20available%20functionality). Bullhorn does not typically charge per API call, but they do require an active subscription that supports API. If the integration is being developed by a third-party provider (like an ISV building a product for many Bullhorn customers), joining the **Bullhorn Developer Partner Program** is advisable. This program provides developer sandbox access, support, and often a partner API key or higher limits for development purposes[\[53\]](https://www.bullhorn.com/news-and-press/press-releases/bullhorn-announces-developer-partner-program-open-source-portal-creating-open-ecosystem-partners-create-incredible-customer-experiences/#:~:text=dedicated%20developer%20API%20key%2C%20and,to%20API%20support%20and). The program may have its own costs or agreements. If the integration is purely internal for one client, then the main concern is just enabling their API and possibly getting a “API user” license (Bullhorn sometimes counts API users separately from regular users, though marketplace integration users often don’t count toward license limits[\[54\]](https://kb.bullhorn.com/ats/Content/BHATS/Topics/understandingBHAPIUsageLimitsVersioningBackwardCompatibility.htm#:~:text=API%20users%20created%20by%20Bullhorn,towards%20your%20API%20user%20limit)).

* **Security and Data Compliance:** Recruitment data is highly sensitive (PII of candidates, confidential client info). The integration must use **secure connections (HTTPS)** for all API calls (Bullhorn only serves API over HTTPS). Bullhorn’s OAuth ensures that the external system never sees the end-user’s Bullhorn password (instead it uses the API user’s credentials and OAuth token exchange). Still, the system should securely store the OAuth client secret and the API user credentials. Treat the BhRestToken like a password – it grants access to the client’s data. It should be stored server-side and never exposed to unauthorized parties. In terms of compliance, if the recruitment automation system is storing candidate data outside of Bullhorn (even temporarily for analytics or processing), ensure compliance with data protection regulations (e.g. **GDPR** in Europe). Bullhorn’s API will allow access to data that might include sensitive fields (like ethnicity, date of birth, etc.), so the integration should handle such data according to the client’s compliance requirements – possibly filtering or anonymizing if needed. Also, when pushing data into Bullhorn, adhere to any data format validations (for example, Bullhorn might require certain date formats or enforce picklist values; using the meta endpoint can help understand allowed values for fields).

* **Audit and Logging:** Bullhorn logs changes made via the API in the system’s audit trail (the “edit history” on records will show changes made by the integration user). The client’s admins should be aware that the API user’s actions will appear in Bullhorn as though that user made the changes. It’s wise to keep an activity log on the integration side as well, to trace what API calls were made (especially for critical data changes). This can assist with debugging and also provide an audit if needed. For instance, if a candidate record was accidentally overwritten, both Bullhorn’s edit history and the integration logs can help identify when and how it happened.

In summary, Bullhorn integration comes with generous API capabilities but requires proper planning around rate limits (particularly if scaling up activity), the right licensing, and diligent security measures. By respecting these constraints and following Bullhorn’s guidelines, the integration can be both powerful and reliable.

## Integration Features vs. Bullhorn API Access Requirements

Finally, the table below summarizes some potential integration features and what Bullhorn API access or endpoints would be required to implement them:

| Integration Feature | Bullhorn APIs & Entities Involved | Required Access Level |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Bi-directional Candidate Sync** – e.g. import/export candidates between systems (with updates). | \- GET/PUT /entity/Candidate (read and update candidate records) \<br\>- GET /entity/Candidate/{id}/fileAttachments (to pull resumes or attachments) \<br\>- event subscription on Candidate for change detection[\[18\]](https://bullhorn.github.io/rest-api-docs/#:~:text=curl%20,services%2Fe999%2Fevent%2Fsubscription%2FAbcde%3Ftype%3Dentity%26names%3DCandidate%20%26eventTypes%3DINSERTED%2CUPDATED%2CDELETED). | API user with **View Any** and **Edit/Add Candidate** permissions[\[55\]](https://community.liveperson.com/kb/articles/1197-configure-the-tenfold-integration-for-bullhorn#:~:text=Type%20Entitlement%20Tenfold%20API%20user,Action%20Edit%20Any%20Comments%20Yes). Read access to all candidate fields (consider admin or equivalent). |
| **Job Order Synchronization** – keep job listings updated and push new jobs. | \- GET/POST /entity/JobOrder (retrieve existing jobs, create new jobs) \<br\>- PUT /entity/JobOrder/{id} (update job status or fields) \<br\>- GET /search/JobOrder for finding jobs by criteria (e.g. open jobs)[\[28\]](https://www.getknit.dev/blog/bullhorn-api-directory-DlpbVe#:~:text=,Retrieve%20List%20of%20Job%20Orders). \<br\>- Possibly event subscription on JobOrder for real-time updates. | **View/Add/Edit Job** permissions for the API user[\[56\]](https://community.liveperson.com/kb/articles/1197-configure-the-tenfold-integration-for-bullhorn#:~:text=Action%20Edit%20Any%20Client%20Yes,Action%20Edit%20Assigned%20Lead%20Yes)[\[57\]](https://community.liveperson.com/kb/articles/1197-configure-the-tenfold-integration-for-bullhorn#:~:text=Action%20View%20Any%20Candidate%20Yes,Action%20View%20Contact%20Attachments%20Yes). Likely requires admin or standard user with job edit rights. |
| **Custom Job Board & Applications** – display Bullhorn jobs on external site, feed applications back. | \- GET /query/JobOrder or /search/JobOrder (list jobs with fields like title, description)[\[28\]](https://www.getknit.dev/blog/bullhorn-api-directory-DlpbVe#:~:text=,Retrieve%20List%20of%20Job%20Orders). \<br\>- POST /entity/Candidate (create new candidate for an applicant) \<br\>- POST /entity/JobSubmission (submit candidate to a job). \<br\>- GET/PUT /entity/ClientContact if creating client contacts for applicants (less common). | **View Job** (for pulling job data) and **Add Candidate**, **Add JobSubmission** rights for the API user. Often requires an Enterprise edition API as this is a common use-case[\[31\]](https://kb.bullhorn.com/ats/Content/BHATS/Topics/customizingBHWithThirdPartySolutions.htm#:~:text=The%20Bullhorn%20API%20allows%20your,or%20deleting%20records%20as%20needed). |
| **Enhanced Analytics Dashboard** – aggregate pipeline metrics, placement data, etc. | \- GET /query/Placement (retrieve placements and related fields like salary, dates) \<br\>- GET /query/JobSubmission (pipeline status counts) \<br\>- GET /query/ClientCorporation and ClientContact (for client metrics) \<br\>- Possibly GET /entity/Note or Search/Note for activity counts. | **View** permissions on **all core entities** (Candidate, Job, Client, Placement, etc.) for comprehensive reporting. The API user likely needs a high-level reporting access (admin or custom report role) to read all records across the company. |
| **Automated Note & Activity Logging** – e.g. log emails, calls to Bullhorn Notes. | \- POST /entity/Note (create note with comments text)[\[30\]](https://bullhorn.github.io/rest-api-docs/entityref.html#:~:text=id%20Integer%20Id%20of%20this,X). \<br\>- Optionally, POST /entity/NoteEntity to link the note to multiple records (though specifying personReference and commentingPerson in the Note POST auto-associates it)[\[2\]](https://bullhorn.github.io/rest-api-docs/entityref.html#:~:text=Represents%20a%20note%20,record%20in%20the%20Bullhorn%20application)[\[58\]](https://bullhorn.github.io/rest-api-docs/entityref.html#:~:text=If%20you%20include%20a%20commentingPerson,call%20to%20create%20a%20NoteEntity). \<br\>- GET /entity/Note (if reading notes back). | **Add Note** and **Edit Comments/Notes** permission for the API user (so it can create notes on records)[\[59\]](https://community.liveperson.com/kb/articles/1197-configure-the-tenfold-integration-for-bullhorn#:~:text=Action%20Allow%20Private%20Candidates%20Yes,Action%20Edit%20Any%20Order%20Yes)[\[60\]](https://community.liveperson.com/kb/articles/1197-configure-the-tenfold-integration-for-bullhorn#:~:text=Action%20Search%20Candidates%20Yes%20Action,View%20All%20Private%20Candidates%20Yes). Also needs at least **View** access to the target entity (e.g., to attach a note to a candidate or job, the user must see that record). |
| **Event-Driven Notifications** – e.g. trigger external actions when Bullhorn data changes. | \- PUT /event/subscription (to subscribe to events on needed entities like Candidate, JobSubmission, Placement, etc.)[\[18\]](https://bullhorn.github.io/rest-api-docs/#:~:text=curl%20,services%2Fe999%2Fevent%2Fsubscription%2FAbcde%3Ftype%3Dentity%26names%3DCandidate%20%26eventTypes%3DINSERTED%2CUPDATED%2CDELETED). \<br\>- GET /event/subscription/{id} (poll for events)[\[45\]](https://bullhorn.github.io/rest-api-docs/#:~:text=,). \<br\>*(Note: events are not an entity per se but part of the API infrastructure.)* | **API access enabled** (Enterprise edition typically, as Corporate edition has a limit of 5 subscriptions[\[61\]](https://kb.bullhorn.com/ats/Content/BHATS/Topics/understandingBHAPIUsageLimitsVersioningBackwardCompatibility.htm#:~:text=,unretrieved%20events%20is%20seven%20days)). The API user must belong to a corp with event subscriptions allowed. No special “permission” flag needed, but the integration must not exceed subscription limits (5 for Corporate, 15 for Enterprise[\[62\]](https://kb.bullhorn.com/ats/Content/BHATS/Topics/understandingBHAPIUsageLimitsVersioningBackwardCompatibility.htm#:~:text=,unused%20subscriptions%20is%20seven%20days)). |
| **Data Enrichment (e.g. skills parsing)** – update Bullhorn records with external data. | \- PUT /entity/Candidate/{id} (update fields such as skills, categories, customText fields with parsed data). \<br\>- Possibly PUT /entity/ClientCorporation/{id} or others if enriching company data. \<br\>- GET /entity/Candidate (to retrieve existing data to combine with new info). | **Edit** permissions on the respective entities (Candidate, etc.) for the API user[\[55\]](https://community.liveperson.com/kb/articles/1197-configure-the-tenfold-integration-for-bullhorn#:~:text=Type%20Entitlement%20Tenfold%20API%20user,Action%20Edit%20Any%20Comments%20Yes). For adding values to picklist fields, the user might need those options configured in Bullhorn (not a permission issue but a configuration aspect). |
| **Placement and Onboarding Integration** – e.g. when a Placement is made, push data to HR systems. | \- GET /entity/Placement/{id} (retrieve placement details when a placement event occurs) \<br\>- GET /entity/Candidate/{id} and ClientContact (to get linked candidate/client info) \<br\>- Possibly event subscription on Placement to know when a placement is created or status changed. \<br\>- If pushing updates back, maybe PUT /entity/Placement/{id} (to update status or add notes). | **View Placement** (and related entities) for pulling data. If updating placement records or adding notes to them, needs **Edit Placement** and/or **Add Note** rights. Many integrations simply read placements and do external tasks, so read-only might suffice in those cases. |

Each feature above illustrates how specific Bullhorn API endpoints and permissions tie into the integration’s functionality. By ensuring the API user has the necessary rights and by using the correct endpoints, the third-party system can seamlessly extend Bullhorn’s capabilities while respecting its security model and limits.
