**Strategic Considerations:**

- **Client Perception:** Some clients may prefer direct invoicing rather than through funder
- **Contract Terms:** Review funding agreement terms (rates, duration, exit clauses) carefully

- **Market Position:** 10+ years in market suggests strong reputation and client base

**Evaluation Approach:**
1. **Needs Assessment:** Identify ProActive's specific cash flow pain points and funding needs
2. **Cost Comparison:** Compare 3R's funding rates to bank overdraft, traditional invoice finance, equity investment
3. **Platform Demo:** Request demo of back-office platform and assess Bullhorn integration
4. **Client References:** Speak with existing 3R clients about experience and service quality
