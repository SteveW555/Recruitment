[OK] System Prompt: Defines the AI's role and classification rules (constant)
[OK] User Prompt: Contains the specific email data to analyze (variable)
[OK] Separation: Keeps instructions separate from data for clarity
[OK] Consistency: Low temperature (0.3) ensures reliable classification
[OK] Structure: JSON output makes integration with TypeScript easy

This pattern is ideal for production systems where you need:
- Consistent behavior across thousands of emails
- Clear separation between rules and data
- Easy testing and validation
- Reliable automated routing
