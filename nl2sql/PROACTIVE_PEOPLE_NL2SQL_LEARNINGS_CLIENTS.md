## üîç Data Patterns Discovered (50-Client Analysis)

### 1. Industry Distribution

**Observed Sectors** (from sample data):
- IT Services & Software Development
- Financial Services & Fintech
- Contact Centres & Call Centres
- Renewable Energy
- Retail & E-commerce
- Healthcare & Pharmaceuticals
- Manufacturing & Engineering
- Professional Services (Legal, Accounting)
- Media & Marketing
- Property & Real Estate

**NL2SQL Consideration**: Industry searches must be case-insensitive and handle variations:
- "IT" vs "Information Technology" vs "Tech"
- "Finance" vs "Financial Services" vs "Fintech"

### 2. Account Tier Distribution

**Tiers Observed**:
- **Bronze**: Entry-level accounts (lower volume)
- **Silver**: Standard accounts (medium volume)
- **Gold**: Premium accounts (high volume)
- **Platinum**: Enterprise accounts (very high volume)

**NL2SQL Consideration**: Tier queries are hierarchical:
- "Gold or better" ‚Üí `account_tier IN ('Gold', 'Platinum')`
- "At least Silver" ‚Üí `account_tier IN ('Silver', 'Gold', 'Platinum')`

### 3. Payment Terms Patterns

**Common Values**:
- Net 30 (most common - 40% of clients)
- Net 45 (30% of clients)
- Net 60 (20% of clients)
- Net 15 (10% of clients - premium)

**NL2SQL Consideration**: Parse numeric days from text:
- "Net 30" ‚Üí 30 days
- "30-day payment terms" ‚Üí `payment_terms = 'Net 30'`

### 4. Company Size Range Notation

**Observed Formats**:
- "150-200" (range with hyphen)
- "500+" (open-ended upper bound)
- "1000-2000" (large companies)
- "50-100" (small companies)

**NL2SQL Challenge**: Cannot use simple numeric comparison:
- "companies with 500+ employees" requires parsing `company_size_range`
- "small companies" ‚Üí interpret as ranges starting below 200

### 5. Service Lines (Comma-Separated)

**Common Patterns**:
- "Recruitment, Assessment, Training"
- "Permanent Recruitment, Contract Staffing"
- "Executive Search, RPO, Managed Service Provider"

**NL2SQL Consideration**: Same pattern as candidate skills:
- Use `ILIKE '%service%'` for partial matching
- Multiple services: `AND` for "both" or `OR` for "either"

### 6. Work Model Preferences

**Values Observed**:
- Remote (20%)
- Hybrid (50%)
- On-Site (25%)
- Flexible (5%)

**NL2SQL Consideration**: Handle synonyms:
- "work from home" ‚Üí "Remote"
- "office-based" ‚Üí "On-Site"
- "mixed" ‚Üí "Hybrid"

### 7. Contact Information Patterns

**Complexity**:
- 100% of clients have primary contact
- 68% have secondary contact
- Primary preferred: Email (60%), Phone (25%), Both (15%)

**NL2SQL Consideration**:
- Searches for "hiring manager" may need to check both contacts
- Filter by preferred contact method for communication planning

### 8. Revenue Patterns

**Ranges Observed**:
- ¬£50,000 - ¬£100,000 (Bronze tier, low volume)
- ¬£100,000 - ¬£500,000 (Silver tier, medium volume)
- ¬£500,000 - ¬£2,000,000 (Gold tier, high volume)
- ¬£2,000,000+ (Platinum tier, enterprise)

**NL2SQL Consideration**: Revenue queries often correlate with tier:
- "top revenue clients" ‚Üí `ORDER BY lifetime_revenue_gbp DESC LIMIT 10`
- "over ¬£1M" ‚Üí `lifetime_revenue_gbp > 1000000`

### 9. Engagement Status Distribution

**Account Status**:
- Active: 82% (41 clients)
- Inactive: 10% (5 clients)
- On Hold: 6% (3 clients)
- Suspended: 2% (1 client)

**NL2SQL Consideration**: Default to Active unless specified:
- "active clients" is redundant but common
- "all clients" should include inactive

### 10. Time-Based Patterns

**Engagement Dates**:
- First engagement: 2015-2024 (9-year span)
- Last placement: Within last 6 months for active clients
- Contract renewal: Clustered at quarter-ends (Mar, Jun, Sep, Dec)

**NL2SQL Consideration**: Date range queries need clear interpretation:
- "new clients" ‚Üí `first_engagement_date > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 year'`
- "recent placements" ‚Üí `last_placement_date > NOW() - INTERVAL '3 months'`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Challenges for Clients Table NL2SQL

### Challenge 1: Comma-Separated Service Lines

**Problem**: Service lines stored as text: `"Recruitment, Assessment, Training"`

**Impact**: Cannot use exact match for "clients who offer assessment services"

**Solution**:
```sql
-- Wrong (exact match fails)
WHERE recruitment_service_lines = 'Assessment'

-- Correct (partial match)
WHERE recruitment_service_lines ILIKE '%Assessment%'

-- Multiple services (both required)
WHERE recruitment_service_lines ILIKE '%Recruitment%'
  AND recruitment_service_lines ILIKE '%Training%'

-- Multiple services (either acceptable)
WHERE recruitment_service_lines ILIKE '%Recruitment%'
   OR recruitment_service_lines ILIKE '%Executive Search%'
```

**System Prompt Requirement**: Explicit guidance with examples

**Expected Accuracy Impact**: +15% on service-related queries

---

### Challenge 2: Company Size Range Parsing

**Problem**: Size stored as text ranges: `"150-200"`, `"500+"`

**Impact**: Cannot directly query "clients with more than 500 employees"

**Solution Options**:

**Option A: Pattern Matching (Simple)**
```sql
-- Companies with 500+ employees
WHERE company_size_range LIKE '500+'
   OR company_size_range LIKE '1000%'
   OR company_size_range LIKE '2000%'

-- Small companies (under 200)
WHERE company_size_range SIMILAR TO '(50-100|100-150|150-200)'
```

**Option B: Parse and Compare (Better for ranges)**
```sql
-- Extract minimum from range (e.g., "150-200" ‚Üí 150)
WHERE CAST(SPLIT_PART(company_size_range, '-', 1) AS INTEGER) >= 500

-- Handle "500+" format
WHERE company_size_range LIKE '%+'
  AND CAST(REPLACE(company_size_range, '+', '') AS INTEGER) >= 500
```

**System Prompt Guidance**:
- "small companies" ‚Üí ranges starting below 200
- "large companies" ‚Üí ranges starting above 500
- "enterprise clients" ‚Üí "1000+" or higher

**Expected Accuracy Impact**: +10% on size-based queries

---

### Challenge 3: Multiple Contact Fields

**Problem**: Two complete contact sets (primary + secondary)

**Impact**: "Find the hiring manager at X company" is ambiguous

**Solution**:
```sql
-- Search both contacts by name
WHERE primary_contact_first_name ILIKE '%John%'
   OR secondary_contact_first_name ILIKE '%John%'

-- Prefer primary contact (default)
SELECT company_name,
       primary_contact_first_name || ' ' || primary_contact_last_name AS contact
FROM clients
WHERE company_name ILIKE '%TechSphere%'

-- Contact with specific preference
WHERE primary_contact_preferred = 'Email'
  AND primary_contact_email IS NOT NULL
```

**System Prompt Guidance**: Default to primary unless "backup" or "secondary" specified

**Expected Accuracy Impact**: +5% on contact queries

---

### Challenge 4: Account Tier Hierarchy

**Problem**: "Gold or better" implies ordering: Bronze < Silver < Gold < Platinum

**Impact**: Simple equality fails for hierarchical queries

**Solution**:
```sql
-- Wrong (misses Platinum)
WHERE account_tier = 'Gold'

-- Correct (hierarchical)
WHERE account_tier IN ('Gold', 'Platinum')

-- Better (tier ordering)
WHERE CASE account_tier
    WHEN 'Bronze' THEN 1
    WHEN 'Silver' THEN 2
    WHEN 'Gold' THEN 3
    WHEN 'Platinum' THEN 4
  END >= 3
```

**System Prompt Guidance**: Include tier hierarchy examples

**Expected Accuracy Impact**: +8% on tier queries

---

### Challenge 5: Date Range Ambiguity

**Problem**: Four date fields with different business meanings:
- `first_engagement_date`: When relationship started
- `last_placement_date`: Most recent successful hire
- `last_contact_date`: Most recent communication
- `contract_renewal_date`: Next renewal

**Impact**: "recent clients" could mean any of the above

**Solution - Interpretation Rules**:
```sql
-- "new clients" ‚Üí first engagement
WHERE first_engagement_date > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 year'

-- "active clients" ‚Üí recent placement
WHERE last_placement_date > NOW() - INTERVAL '6 months'

-- "clients to contact" ‚Üí no recent contact
WHERE last_contact_date < NOW() - INTERVAL '1 month'

-- "clients up for renewal" ‚Üí renewal date approaching
WHERE contract_renewal_date BETWEEN NOW() AND NOW() + INTERVAL '30 days'
```

**System Prompt Guidance**: Define default interpretations for each context

**Expected Accuracy Impact**: +12% on date queries

---

## üí° System Prompt Design for Clients Table

### Key Sections Required

1. **Complete Schema Documentation** (52 columns with descriptions)
2. **Case-Insensitive Matching Rules** (mandatory ILIKE for all text)
3. **Service Lines Matching** (comma-separated with ILIKE '%service%')
4. **Company Size Interpretation** (range parsing and comparison)
5. **Contact Field Defaults** (primary vs secondary logic)
6. **Account Tier Hierarchy** (Bronze < Silver < Gold < Platinum)
7. **Date Field Interpretation** (which date for which query type)
8. **Payment Terms Parsing** (extract numeric days from text)
9. **Output Format** (SQL only, no explanations)
10. **25+ Diverse Examples** (covering all query patterns)

### Example Queries to Include in System Prompt

**Simple Queries (Complexity 1-3)**:
1. "Show all active clients"
2. "Find clients in the financial services industry"
3. "Which clients are in Bristol?"
4. "Show platinum tier clients"
5. "List clients with email as preferred contact method"

**Medium Queries (Complexity 4-6)**:
6. "Show clients offering recruitment and assessment services"
7. "Find clients with more than 500 employees"
8. "Which clients have had placements in the last 3 months?"
9. "Show clients with credit limits over ¬£50,000"
10. "Find clients with net 30 payment terms"
11. "Which clients prefer hybrid work models?"
12. "Show clients with contracts renewing in the next 60 days"

**Complex Queries (Complexity 7-8)**:
13. "Find gold or platinum clients in IT with over ¬£1M revenue"
14. "Show clients in London with 3+ interview stages and background checks required"
15. "Which active clients have had no placements in the last 6 months?"
16. "Find clients with high candidate volume preference and salary ranges over ¬£80k"
17. "Show clients who need assessments and prefer remote work"

**Very Complex Queries (Complexity 9-10)**:
18. "List silver+ clients with lifetime revenue over ¬£500k who prefer email contact and have contracts renewing in Q1 2025"
19. "Find top 10 clients by revenue in financial services with more than 5 active jobs"
20. "Show clients with 4+ interview stages requiring background checks, located in Bristol or London, with platinum tier"

**Aggregation Queries**:
21. "How many active clients do we have?"
22. "What's the average time to fill for gold tier clients?"
23. "Total lifetime revenue by account tier"
24. "Count clients by industry sector"
25. "Average number of active jobs per client"

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Requirements (Same Three-Layer Defense)

### Layer 1: Input Sanitization

**Function**: `sanitizeNlInputForSqlLLM()`

**Operations**:
- Remove SQL comments (`--`, `/* */`)
- Remove quotes (`'`, `"`)
- Remove semicolons (`;`)
- Trim whitespace
- Log all sanitization events

**Critical**: Apply BEFORE sending to LLM

---

### Layer 2: Temperature Control

**Settings**:
- **SQL Generation**: `temperature = 0.2` (deterministic, no creativity)
- **Clarity Evaluation**: `temperature = 0.3-0.4` (slight flexibility)

**Rationale**: SQL must be precise, not creative

---

### Layer 3: RPC-Based Execution

**Pattern**:
```typescript
// Execute via Supabase RPC (server-side isolation)
const { data, error } = await supabase.rpc('execute_sql', {
  query_text: cleanedSqlQuery
});

// NOT direct query execution (vulnerable to injection)
```

**Benefits**:
- Server-side validation
- Query isolation
- Rate limiting enforcement
- Audit trail

---
