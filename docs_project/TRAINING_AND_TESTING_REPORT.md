**Philosophy**: *"Sometimes your previous hire just needs a bit of training or coaching to get them performing."*

### 2. Service Philosophy & Business Case

#### Core Principle: "Fix Don't Fire"
Rather than dismissing underperforming employees or recruiting replacements, ProActive People advocates investing in existing staff through targeted training interventions.

#### Business Case for Training vs. Replacement:

**Traditional HR Approach** (Expensive & Demoralizing):

- **Cost**: £15,000-£30,000+ (recruitment fees, lost productivity, onboarding time)
- **Timeline**: 3-6 months to get new hire to full productivity
- **Morale Impact**: Negative ripple effect on team, perception of "disposable" culture

**Training Approach** (Cost-Effective & Supportive):
- Identify performance gap → Training needs analysis → Custom training program → Performance improvement
- **Cost**: £2,000-£10,000 (training program)
- **Timeline**: 4-12 weeks to see improvement
- **Morale Impact**: Positive signal that company invests in people, improved retention

**ROI Calculation**:
- Training investment: £5,000

## Psychometric Testing Deep Dive

### 1. What is Psychometric Testing?

**Definition**: Psychometric testing is a scientific method of measuring an individual's mental capabilities, behavioral style, and personality traits to predict job performance and cultural fit.

**Purpose in Recruitment**:
- Reduce mis-hires (costly mistakes in candidate selection)
- Improve candidate-role fit
- Ensure manager-employee compatibility
- Predict long-term success and retention
- Provide objective, data-driven hiring decisions
- Remove unconscious bias from selection process

### 2. ProActive People's 3-Step Assessment Strategy

This is the **recommended process**, especially for small teams where manager compatibility is critical:

#### Step 1: Test the Hiring Manager
**Purpose**: Understand the manager's working style, expectations, and team dynamics

**What We Assess**:
- Manager's personality profile
- Leadership style (directive, collaborative, coaching, etc.)
- Communication preferences (direct vs. nuanced, formal vs. casual)
- Work pace expectations (fast-paced vs. methodical)
- Decision-making approach
- Team culture and values

**Tools Used**:
- Manager personality assessment (30-45 minutes)
- Leadership style inventory
- Work preferences questionnaire

**Output**: Manager profile report identifying:
- Ideal employee traits for compatibility
- Potential friction points with certain personality types
- Communication strategies for the manager

#### Step 2: Relate Tests to Role & Manager
**Purpose**: Map role requirements and align with manager's style to define success criteria

**Activities**:
- Job analysis: Break down role into key competencies
- Manager compatibility mapping: Identify traits that complement manager's style
- Success criteria definition: What does "good performance" look like in this context?
- Risk identification: What personality traits might clash with manager or team?

**Output**:
- Role success profile
- Ideal candidate scorecard
- "Red flag" criteria (traits to avoid)

#### Step 3: Test Candidates
**Purpose**: Administer assessments and compare results to role requirements and manager compatibility to predict success probability

**What We Assess**:
- Cognitive abilities (can they do the job intellectually?)
- Personality traits (will they enjoy the work and fit the culture?)
- Behavioral tendencies (how will they approach tasks and challenges?)
- Manager compatibility (will they work well with this specific manager?)
- Team fit (will they integrate with existing team dynamics?)

**Output**:
- Candidate assessment report
- Fit score (role, manager, team, culture)
- Success probability rating (Low, Medium, High)
- Interview probing questions based on assessment results
- Hiring recommendation with rationale

### 3. Benefits of the 3-Step Approach

**Data-Driven Decisions**:
- Removes "gut feeling" hiring
- Provides objective comparison between candidates
- Reduces unconscious bias (age, gender, ethnicity, appearance)

**Manager Compatibility Focus**:
- Critical insight: People leave managers, not companies
- By testing manager first, we ensure candidate can work effectively with that specific leader
- Reduces early turnover due to management style mismatch

**Better Long-Term Outcomes**:
- 40-60% reduction in mis-hires (industry benchmark)
- 25-35% improvement in 12-month retention
- Faster integration and time-to-productivity
- Improved team morale (fewer "bad fit" hires)

**Cost Savings**:
- Avoid £15,000-£30,000 cost per mis-hire
- Reduced recruitment churn
- Lower training costs (better initial fit = faster ramp-up)

### 4. When Psychometric Testing is Used

**Mandatory Use Cases** (ProActive People recommendations):
- Sales roles (assess motivation, resilience, persuasion traits)
- Leadership/management positions (assess leadership potential, decision-making)
- High-value roles (£50,000+ salaries where mis-hire cost is significant)
- Small teams (where manager compatibility is critical)
- Client-facing roles (assess emotional intelligence, communication style)

**Optional Use Cases** (Client discretion):
- Volume recruitment (assessment centers for contact centre roles)
- Graduate programs (identify high-potential early-career talent)
- Technical roles (supplement with skills testing)
- Any role where cultural fit is paramount

**Less Common Use Cases**:
- Very junior roles (£18,000-£22,000 salaries) - cost may outweigh benefit
- Temporary assignments (short-term placements)
- Highly commoditized roles where specific traits less critical

### 5. Types of Psychometric Tests Used

#### Personality Tests
**Purpose**: Measure stable personality traits

**Common Frameworks**:
- **Big Five (OCEAN)**: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism
- **DISC**: Dominance, Influence, Steadiness, Conscientiousness
- **16PF**: 16 Personality Factors

**Example Application (Sales Role)**:
- High Extraversion: Enjoys interacting with prospects, energized by social contact
- High Conscientiousness: Organized, follows up reliably, meets deadlines
- Moderate Agreeableness: Persuasive but not pushover, can handle rejection
- Low Neuroticism: Resilient, handles stress well, bounces back from setbacks

**Scoring**: Trait scores on continuum (e.g., Extraversion: 72/100 = "High Extravert")

#### Aptitude Tests (Cognitive Ability)
**Purpose**: Measure mental horsepower and learning ability

**Test Types**:
- **Verbal Reasoning**: Understanding written information, drawing conclusions
- **Numerical Reasoning**: Working with numbers, data interpretation, calculations
- **Abstract Reasoning**: Pattern recognition, logical thinking, problem-solving

**Example Application (Technical Role)**:
- Verbal: Score 65/100 (Above Average) - Can understand technical documentation
- Numerical: Score 78/100 (High) - Strong analytical thinking for system design
- Abstract: Score 82/100 (Very High) - Excellent at troubleshooting complex problems

**Scoring**: Percentile ranking (e.g., 78th percentile = better than 78% of norm group)

#### Situational Judgment Tests (SJTs)
**Purpose**: Assess how candidates approach work scenarios

**Format**: Present realistic work situations, candidate chooses best response

**Example Scenario (Customer Service)**:
> "A customer is extremely angry about a delayed delivery and is shouting at you on the phone. What do you do?"
> A) Apologize and offer immediate refund
> B) Listen empathetically, validate concern, investigate issue, propose solution
> C) Escalate to manager immediately
> D) Explain company policy on delivery times

**Scoring**: Responses compared to "expert" answers (what high performers would do)

### 6. Assessment Integration with Recruitment

**When Assessment Happens** (ProActive People process):

**Option 1: Pre-Interview Screening** (Common for volume roles)
- Assessment sent after CV review, before interview
- Only candidates who "pass" assessment proceed to interview
- Faster filtering, saves interview time

**Option 2: Post-First Interview** (Common for senior roles)
- Assessment sent after initial culture-fit interview
- Used to inform second-round interview questions
- Deeper insights into strengths/development areas

**Option 3: Final Stage** (Before offer)
- Assessment used as final confirmation before offer
- Validates interview impressions
- Provides onboarding insights (how to best manage this person)

**ProActive People's Recommendation**: Option 2 (post-first interview)
- Avoids candidate drop-off (some candidates dislike pre-interview tests)
- Allows consultant to explain value of assessment
- Results inform deeper second interview
- Most balanced approach

### 7. Pricing and Bundling

**Assessment Service Pricing**:
- **Per-Candidate Assessment**: £50-£200 per candidate
- **Bespoke Assessment Design**: £1,000-£5,000 (one-time)
- **Manager Profiling**: £200-£500 per manager
- **Consultancy (Strategy Design)**: £500-£2,000

**Bundling with Recruitment**:
- Often included or discounted when bundled with permanent recruitment
- Typical offer: "If you give us your recruitment business, we'll include assessment at no additional cost for the first 3 placements"
- Add-on pricing for clients who want assessment for all roles

**Example Pricing Model**:
- Standard recruitment fee: 18% of salary (£40,000 role = £7,200)
- With assessment add-on: 20% of salary (£40,000 role = £8,000)
- Assessment cost: £800 (covered by 2% fee uplift)

### 3. When Assessment Adds Most Value

**High-Value Scenarios** (assessment strongly recommended):
1. **Small teams** where every hire is critical
2. **Manager compatibility concerns** (history of clashes)
3. **High-salary roles** (£50,000+) where mis-hire cost is significant
4. **Sales roles** requiring specific personality traits
5. **Leadership positions** where wrong hire impacts entire team
6. **Cultural fit paramount** (e.g., mission-driven organizations)
7. **Technical roles** requiring problem-solving ability
8. **Client request** for objective selection criteria

**Lower-Value Scenarios** (assessment optional):
1. **Very junior roles** (£18,000-£22,000) - cost may exceed benefit
2. **Temporary assignments** (short-term placements, cultural fit less critical)
3. **Trial shift available** (hospitality, retail) - on-the-job assessment
4. **High-volume recruitment** (100+ hires) - cost and time prohibitive
5. **Specialized roles** where qualifications and experience trump personality

### 4. Assessment Workflow (ProActive People)

**Administered by**: Person 5 (Finance, Training & Assessment Lead)
**Supported by**: Person 1 or Person 2 (consultant managing placement)

**Typical Timeline**:
- **Day 1**: Candidate completes consultant interview
- **Day 2**: Assessment link sent to candidate
- **Day 3-4**: Candidate completes assessment (30-90 minutes)
- **Day 5**: Person 5 reviews results, generates report
- **Day 6**: Person 1/2 receives report, discusses with Person 5
- **Day 7**: Client presented with candidate + assessment report
- **Day 8-14**: Client interviews candidate (armed with assessment insights)

**Turnaround Time**: 5-7 days from initial interview to client presentation (vs. 3-4 days without assessment)

### 5. Client Communication About Assessment

**How ProActive People Positions Assessment**:

**Initial Discussion** (Person 1 or 2 during job brief):
> "We offer assessment services to help ensure the candidate fits not just the role, but also your team and management style. For this position, would you like us to include psychometric testing and personality profiling? It's often bundled with our recruitment service, or available as an add-on."

**When Client is Hesitant** (cost concern):
> "I understand assessment adds cost. However, for a role at this salary level (£50,000), a mis-hire could cost you £15,000-£30,000 in recruitment fees, lost productivity, and team disruption. Our assessment costs £500-£800 per candidate but can reduce mis-hire risk by 40-60%. It's an investment that typically pays for itself."

**When Client is Skeptical** (validity concern):
> "Our assessments are backed by decades of psychometric research and used by FTSE 100 companies. We use platforms like Thomas International and SHL, which have strong predictive validity. I'd be happy to share case studies of clients who've seen measurable improvements in retention and performance. We can also start with a pilot - assess the first 2 candidates and evaluate the value before committing to all hires."

**Success Story Example** (Person 1 to prospective client):
> "We recently worked with a tech company that was struggling with sales team turnover - they were losing 3-4 salespeople per year. We implemented our 3-step assessment process: tested the sales manager first, then aligned our candidate search to compatible personality profiles. In the 18 months since, they've hired 5 salespeople, and all 5 are still there and exceeding targets. The client told me the assessment was 'the difference-maker' in finally building a stable team."

## ROI and Business Case

### 1. The Cost of Mis-Hires

**Direct Costs**:
- Recruitment fee paid: £6,000-£20,000 (depending on role)
- Recruitment fee for replacement: £6,000-£20,000 (unless free replacement used)
- Onboarding costs: £2,000-£5,000 (training, equipment, admin time)
- Lost productivity: 3-6 months at 50% productivity = £7,500-£15,000 (for £50,000 role)

**Indirect Costs**:
- Team morale impact (colleagues cover workload during vacancy)
- Client/customer dissatisfaction (if role is client-facing)
- Manager time spent on performance management (40-80 hours)
- Institutional knowledge lost (if previous hire developed company-specific knowledge)

**Total Cost of Mis-Hire**: £20,000-£50,000+ per instance

### 2. ROI of Assessment

**Assessment Investment**:
- Per-candidate cost: £50-£200 (depending on platform and depth)
- Typical scenario: Assess 3 candidates for 1 role = £150-£600

**ROI Calculation** (Conservative):
- Assessment cost: £500 (3 candidates @ £167 each)
- Mis-hire reduction: 40% (industry average)
- Cost of mis-hire: £25,000
- Expected savings: £25,000 x 40% = £10,000
- **Net ROI**: £10,000 - £500 = £9,500 per hire (1,900% ROI)

**ROI Calculation** (Best Case):
- Assessment cost: £500
- Mis-hire prevention: 1 avoided mis-hire
- Cost of mis-hire: £30,000
- **Net ROI**: £30,000 - £500 = £29,500 per avoided mis-hire (5,900% ROI)

### 3. ROI of Training vs. Replacement

**Scenario: Underperforming Employee**

**Option A: Fire & Replace** (Traditional Approach)

## Implementation Recommendations

### 1. For ProActive People (Internal Improvements)

#### A. Assessment Service Productization

**Current State** (inferred):
- Assessment offered as "add-on" or discussed during requirement stage
- Bundled with recruitment or additional fee
- Ad-hoc administration

**Recommended Future State**:
- **Standardized packages**:
  - **Bronze**: Skills testing only (£50-£100 per candidate)
  - **Silver**: Skills + personality profiling (£150-£250 per candidate)
  - **Gold**: Full battery + manager profiling + bespoke strategy (£500-£1,000 per candidate)
- **Clear pricing** on website and sales materials
- **Case studies** demonstrating ROI
- **Free trial**: Offer 1-2 assessments free for new clients to demonstrate value

#### B. 3-Step Process Standardization

**Current State**: Likely offered when relevant, but not systematized

**Recommended Future State**:
- **Default for small teams** (<20 people): Always recommend manager profiling first
- **Assessment strategy workshop**: 2-hour workshop with client (chargeable or bundled)
- **Manager profiling as standalone service**: £500 - sell separately, leads to recruitment

#### C. Technology Stack Investment

**Current State**: Likely using one or two platforms ad-hoc

**Recommended Future State**:
- **Primary platform**: Thomas International (annual license for unlimited use)
- **Skills testing**: Subscription to Microsoft Office testing platform
- **Technical testing**: HackerRank or similar (pay-per-test or annual license)
- **Integration**: Bullhorn ATS integration to store assessment results with candidate records

**Investment**: £5,000-£15,000 per year for comprehensive platform access
**ROI**: Enables assessment on every placement, increases differentiation, higher fees

#### D. Person 5 Skill Development

**Current State**: Person 5 manages assessment but may lack deep psychometric expertise

**Recommended Future State**:
- **Certification**: BPS Level A (Ability) and Level B (Personality) certification for Person 5
- **Training**: Thomas International practitioner certification
- **Ongoing development**: Annual conference attendance (British Psychological Society, Assessment & Development)

**Investment**: £2,000-£5,000 for certifications
**ROI**: Credibility with clients, deeper interpretation, upsell opportunities

#### E. Marketing and Positioning

**Current State**: Assessment mentioned on website, not heavily promoted

**Recommended Future State**:
- **Dedicated landing page**: https://www.proactivepeople.com/assessment (with ROI calculator)
- **Case studies**: 3-5 detailed case studies with metrics
- **Blog content**: "Why Psychometric Testing Reduces Mis-Hires" (SEO)
- **Client webinar**: "How to Hire Right the First Time" (lead generation)
- **Email campaign**: Existing clients offered assessment audit

**Investment**: Marketing time (Person 3) + potential external support (£2,000-£5,000)
**ROI**: Increased assessment penetration from 38% to 60%+ of clients

### 2. For Clients (Adoption Recommendations)

#### A. Start Small (Pilot Program)

**Recommendation**: Test assessment on next 2-3 hires before full commitment

**Pilot Structure**:
1. Assess 2-3 candidates for 1 role (control: interview-only selection)
2. Hire best candidate based on assessment + interview
3. Track performance at 3, 6, and 12 months
4. Compare to historical hires (no assessment)
5. Evaluate ROI and decide on broader rollout

**Benefits**:
- Low-risk trial (£500-£1,500 investment)
- Data-driven decision on continued use
- Builds internal buy-in if successful

#### B. Focus on High-Impact Roles First

**Recommended Prioritization**:
1. **Leadership roles** (highest team impact)
2. **Sales roles** (personality-performance correlation strong)
3. **Small team hires** (every hire matters)
4. **Client-facing roles** (brand risk)
5. **Technical roles** (cognitive ability predictive)
6. **Entry-level roles** (lowest priority unless volume is very high)

#### C. Manager Buy-In Strategy

**Challenge**: Hiring managers may resist "being tested"

**Solution**:
- Frame as "helping us find people you'll love working with"
- Manager profiling is confidential (only shared with consultant, not HR/executives)
- Position as "team effectiveness tool" not "manager evaluation"
- Highlight success stories of compatible hires

**Example Script** (Person 1 to hiring manager):
> "We've found that the best predictor of long-term success isn't just whether the candidate can do the job, but whether they'll work well with you specifically. That's why we recommend profiling your working style first. It's completely confidential - we use it purely to find candidates who'll complement your management approach. Think of it as getting a tailored recruitment service rather than generic candidate lists."

#### D. Use Assessment for Development, Not Just Selection

**Expanded Use Cases**:
1. **Onboarding**: Assessment results inform new hire onboarding plan
2. **Performance management**: Revisit assessment if performance issues arise (is role fit or training gap?)
3. **Team building**: Understand team dynamics, personality diversity
4. **Promotion decisions**: Assess leadership potential before promoting
5. **Succession planning**: Identify high-potential employees for development

**Example**: Bristol Financial Group (CLI-002)
- Uses assessment for selection (Year 1)
- Repeats assessment for promotion to management (Year 3)
- Uses results to inform personalized development plans
- Emma Jane (wellbeing) references assessment when supporting struggling employees

### 3. For Candidates (Best Practices)

#### A. Candidate Communication

**Before Assessment**:
- Explain purpose: "Helps us find you the best-fit role, not just any role"
- Clarify it's not pass/fail: "No right or wrong answers, just understanding your strengths"
- Provide timeline: "Takes 30-60 minutes, complete within 48 hours"
- Address concerns: "Your results are confidential, only shared with you and client"

**After Assessment**:
- Provide feedback: "Your assessment showed strong analytical thinking and attention to detail"
- Explain how it informed decision: "Based on your results, we think you'd thrive in this role because..."
- Offer full report (optional): "Would you like a copy of your full assessment report for your own development?"

#### B. Candidate Preparation Guidance

**What to Tell Candidates**:
- Be honest: Assessment detects inconsistent responses (lying is counterproductive)
- Answer instinctively: Don't overthink personality questions
- Take skills tests seriously: Demonstrate your best work on technical tests
- Use quiet environment: Minimize distractions for accurate results
- Don't "game" the test: Answer how you actually are, not how you think client wants

**What Not to Say**:
- "Study for the test" (personality tests aren't "studied" for)
- "It's just a formality" (minimizes importance, reduces candidate effort)
- "Everyone passes" (untrue and sets wrong expectation)
