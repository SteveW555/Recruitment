# Session Artifacts Directory

## Purpose

This directory contains working documents created by Claude Code during development
sessions. These files are NOT part of the core project documentation or codebase.

## What's Here

These documents served as:
- Architecture analysis and decision-making notes
- Implementation planning documents
- Technical exploration and reasoning artifacts
- Session-specific working documents

They were created to help Claude organize its thinking during complex tasks but
are not intended as primary project documentation.

## Why Keep Them?

These artifacts are preserved for:
- Historical reference of architectural decisions
- Understanding the reasoning behind implementation choices
- Session context if needed for future work
- Audit trail of development decisions

## What to Do With Them

- **Reference:** If you need to understand why a technical decision was made
- **Archive:** Move to long-term storage if they contain valuable insights
- **Delete:** Can be safely removed once their context is no longer needed

## Core Project Documentation

For actual project documentation, see:
- `/README.md` - Main project overview
- `/PROGRESS.md` - Development progress log
- `/docs_root/` - Complete project documentation
- `/CLAUDE.md` - Project instructions for Claude Code
