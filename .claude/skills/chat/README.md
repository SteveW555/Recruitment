# Chat System Expert Skill

A comprehensive skill providing expert knowledge about the ProActive People chat system architecture, agents, classification, and configuration.

## What This Skill Covers

This skill makes Claude an expert in answering questions about:

- **Chat Interface & Architecture** - How the React frontend, Express backend, and Python AI Router work together
- **7 Specialized Agents** - Each agent's purpose, configuration, LLM model, tools, and when it's used
- **Query Classification** - Both regex (frontend) and semantic ML (AI Router) classification systems
- **API Endpoints** - Complete reference for `/api/chat`, `/api/chat/clear`, `/api/chat/stats`
- **Configuration Management** - agents.json structure, environment variables, LLM model selection
- **Data Flow** - Step-by-step journey of messages from frontend through routing to LLM and back
- **Session Management** - Conversation history, context persistence, message trimming
- **Routing Logic** - Confidence thresholds, fallback mechanisms, timeout/retry strategies
- **Performance & Reliability** - Latency targets, throughput, error handling, monitoring

## Use This Skill When

Ask Claude about:
- "How does the chat interface work?"
- "What agents are available and when are they used?"
- "How are queries classified and routed?"
- "What API endpoints are available?"
- "How do I configure an agent?"
- "How does conversation history work?"
- "What are the performance targets?"
- "How do I add a new agent?"
- "What LLM models are being used?"
- "How does semantic classification work?"
- "What happens when an agent times out?"
- "How do I debug routing issues?"
- "How can I improve classification accuracy?"
- "What temperature settings should I use?"
- "How do I change which LLM an agent uses?"

Any question about how the chat system works, how to configure it, how to extend it, or how to debug issues.

## Content Highlights

### Architecture Overview
- Detailed 3-layer architecture with data flow diagrams
- Frontend regex classification for immediate feedback
- Backend message assembly and LLM API calls
- AI Router semantic classification using sentence transformers
- Session management (in-memory, Redis, PostgreSQL)

### Agent System
- 7 specialized agents with different priorities (P1, P2, P3)
- Agent contract: timeout protection, error handling, response format
- Agent Registry for dynamic loading
- Configuration-driven agent definitions

### Classification
- Dual-layer approach: regex (fast) + semantic ML (accurate)
- Sentence transformer model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) for embeddings
- Cosine similarity for semantic matching
- Confidence thresholds (0.7 for primary routing)
- Secondary category routing when 0.5-0.7 confidence

### Performance & Reliability
- <100ms classification latency (semantic)
- <2s agent execution timeout
- <3s end-to-end latency target
- Automatic retry with 500ms delay
- Fallback to General Chat on failures
- All failures logged to PostgreSQL

### Configuration Options
- Change LLM models per agent
- Disable/enable agents at runtime
- Temperature tuning for creativity vs accuracy
- Token limits and max response length
- Example query management for classification
- Timeout and retry configuration
