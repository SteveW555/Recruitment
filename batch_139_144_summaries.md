- **Sector Specialization:** Sales, accountancy, contact center, IT support (different from Tiger's business support focus)
- **Bristol/Regional Presence:** Strong regional presence vs. Tiger's London focus
- **SME Client Focus:** Tiger targets corporates/UHNWI; ProActive serves broader SME market
- **Pricing:** Likely more accessible pricing vs. Tiger's premium model

**Market Differentiation:**

**Tiger's Niche:**
- **Business Support Specialists:** PAs, EAs, admin (ProActive does some but not core focus)
- **UHNWI/Private Household:** Tiger Private division (ProActive doesn't serve this market)
- **Executive-Level:** C-suite support roles (higher-end than ProActive's typical placements)
- **Global Corporate Clients:** Multinational corporations and private equity firms

**ProActive's Niche:**
- **Sales Recruitment:** Business Development, Telesales, Field Sales, Fundraising (Tiger doesn't focus on sales)
- **Accountancy:** Corporate Tax, Audit, General Practice accountants (Tiger does finance but different roles)
- **Contact Centre:** Customer Service, Telesales specialists (Tiger doesn't serve this market)
- **IT Support:** Technical support roles (Tiger Digital focuses on development, not IT support)

**Strategic Insights:**

**Learning from Tiger:**
1. **Thought Leadership:** Annual salary survey builds credibility and generates leads
2. **Google Reviews:** 234 reviews demonstrate commitment to reputation management (ProActive should encourage Google reviews)
3. **B Corp Certification:** Values-driven branding resonates with modern employers and candidates
4. **Specialist Divisions:** Dedicated teams for each specialism (business support, private, finance, HR, digital) vs. generalist approach
5. **International Expansion:** Structured office network (vs. ad-hoc international placements)
6. **EOR Service:** Adding Employer of Record service creates new revenue stream

**Competitive Response:**

**ProActive Should:**
1. **Emphasize Differentiation:** Clearly position as sales/accountancy/contact center specialists (not business support generalists like Tiger)
2. **Regional Strength:** Leverage Bristol/Southwest presence vs. Tiger's London focus
3. **SME Focus:** Position as accessible, agile partner for SMEs vs. Tiger's corporate focus
4. **Thought Leadership:** Consider annual salary survey for sales/accountancy roles to match Tiger's approach
5. **Google Reviews:** Actively encourage satisfied clients to leave Google reviews
6. **Values Branding:** Explore B Corp certification or similar values-driven credentials

**Not Direct Threat:**
- Limited overlap in core markets (Tiger = business support/private, ProActive = sales/accountancy/contact center)
- Geographic focus differs (Tiger = London/global, ProActive = Bristol/regional)
- Client segments differ (Tiger = corporates/UHNWI, ProActive = SMEs)
