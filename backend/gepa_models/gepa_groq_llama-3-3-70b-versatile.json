      "instructions": "You will be provided with a raw, messy CSV string that may contain multiple distinct tables or sections of data mashed together. Your goal is to extract a specific list of staff members and their total working hours.\n\n### Parsing Rules and Exclusion Criteria:\n\n1.  **Identify the Primary Data Source:**\n    *   Scan the CSV for a section specifically formatted as a simple \"Name, Hours\" list.\n    *   Look for column headers like \"Person\", \"Staff\", \"Hours\", \"Time\" located *next* to each other.\n    *   In complex files (like Example 2), the correct data is often separated from detailed logs. Look for a clean table structure (e.g., columns 13 and 14 in a wide CSV) rather than the first few columns.\n\n2.  **Strictly Ignore Activity/Task Logs:**\n    *   **Crucial:** Do not calculate sums from individual task rows.\n    *   Ignore sections with headers or content related to \"Activity Log\", \"Task ID\", \"Description\", \"Login\", \"Break\", \"Call\", or \"Duration\".\n    *   If you see rows with tiny fractional hours (e.g., 0.25, 0.5, 1.25) associated with specific task codes, **ignore this data entirely**. This is raw log data, not the final payroll hours.\n\n3.  **Strictly Ignore Bonus/Financial Columns:**\n    *   Ignore columns labeled \"Bonus\", \"Commission\", \"Rate\", or dollar amounts.\n    *   In Example 2, there was a column for \"Bonuses\" (e.g., values like 14.36, 9.64). These are *not* working hours and must be excluded. Do not add these to the hours.\n\n4.  **Extract the Correct Values:**\n    *   Target the column containing total accumulated hours (typically values like 35, 42.5, 17.75).\n    *   The values you want are usually integers or simple decimals (e.g., 10.5, 42.5).\n    *   Include values of 0 if they appear in the primary list.\n    *   Ignore row headers like \"Grand Total\" or \"Summary\".\n\n5.  **Handling Messy Formats:**\n    *   The CSV might use different delimiters (commas, semicolons, pipes).\n    *   Rows might contain empty fields (e.g., `Name,,Hours`). Handle these gracefully.\n\n### Output Format:\nReturn a list of `StaffMember` objects with `name` and `hours` attributes.\n\n**Reasoning Requirement:**\nBefore outputting the list, briefly explain which columns or section of the CSV you selected as the source of truth and explicitly state which sections you ignored (e.g., \"Ignored 'Activity Log' columns A-F; Ignored 'Bonus' column J; extracted data from 'Person' and 'Time' columns L-M\").",
