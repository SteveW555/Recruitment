Your objective is to parse this string to identify the **primary summary table** of staff members and their total worked hours, extract this data, and return a list of `StaffMember` objects.\n        \n        ### 1. Identify the Primary Data Source\n        The CSV may contain multiple sections, metadata, or secondary tables. You must locate the single \"main\" table summarizing staff totals.\n        *   **Target Headers:** Look for a row containing a combination of a Name column (e.g., `Staff Member`, `EmpName`, `Who`, `Person`, `Name`, `Employee`) and a Time column (e.g., `Hours`, `Duration`, `Qty`, `Total hours`, `Billable`, `Worked`, `Total Time`).\n        *   **Data Structure:** The primary data usually appears as a contiguous list of names and numbers.\n        *   **Key Constraints (What to Ignore):**\n            *   **Ignore Detail Logs:** Do *not* extract data from sections labeled \"Activity Log\", \"Detailed Activity Log\", \"Task ID\", \"ProjectName\", or specific shift details.\n            *   **Ignore Metadata headers:** Ignore file headers like \"Confidential Report\", \"Generated by...\", or date lines unless they are part of the specific row being processed.\n            *   **Ignore Footers:** Stop processing if you encounter footer markers like \"---metadata break---\", \"Reported By\", or \"END FOOTER\" *unless* a valid summary table appears clearly after them (e.g., a \"Reported By\" section might actually contain the valid staff list if the top section was just a header). *Crucial: If multiple tables exist, assess which one looks like the summary roster versus a specific task list.*\n        \n        ### 2. Extraction & Cleaning Rules\n        For every valid row in the primary table:\n        *   **Name:** Extract the string from the identified Name column. Remove prefixes/suffixes if present (e.g., \"c.\", \"~\").\n        *   **Hours:** Extract the numerical value from the identified Time column.\n            *   Remove non-numeric characters (e.g., \"hr\", \"approx\").\n            *   Convert to a float.\n        \n        ### 3. Filtering Logic (Strict)\n        *   **INCLUDE Zero Values:** If a staff member is listed in the main summary table with `0.0` or `0` hours, **keep them**. This indicates they are on the roster but didn't work.\n        *   **INCLUDE High Values:** Keep all standard working hours (e.g., 3.0, 40.5, 12.0).\n        *   **EXCLUDE Fractional Fragments (Contextual):**\n            *   If a value is extremely small (e.g., < 1.0) *and* appears in a context suggesting it is a specific task fragment rather than a total (often found in detailed logs), exclude it.\n            *   *However*, if the value is in the clear main summary list (e.g., a row says \"Henry Ford, 1.06\"), **keep it**. The location in the primary table overrides the value size.\n        *   **Handling Multiple Lists:** If the CSV contains disjointed lists of names and hours (e.g., a list at the top, a metadata break, and then another list of names), **combine them** if they both appear to be valid staff summaries. Do not stop at the first blank line if valid data follows shortly after in a similar format.\n        \n        ### 4. Output Format\n        Return a list of `StaffMember` objects.\n        *   Format: `[StaffMember(name='Name Here', hours=12.3), ...]`"
