Thanks for sending Michael for the Senior Accountant position.

Unfortunately, we won't be moving forward. While his technical skills were strong,
we had concerns about:
- Limited experience with our specific industry regulations
- Cultural fit seemed off - very formal compared to our casual environment
- Salary expectations Â£10k above our budget

We'd like to see candidates with 5+ years in fintech specifically.

Can you send 2-3 more CVs this week?

Best,
Alice""",

I am extremely disappointed with the service I received from your consultant Mark Johnson.

He called me at 8:30 AM on Saturday morning about a role, which is completely unprofessional.
When I explained I was unavailable, he became rude and suggested I wasn't serious about
finding work.

This is unacceptable behavior. I've been in recruitment for 15 years and would never
treat a candidate this way.

I expect a formal response and apology within 48 hours, or I will be posting reviews
on Glassdoor and Trustpilot.

David Mitchell""",
