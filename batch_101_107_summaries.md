Reddit is a massive social news aggregation, content rating, and discussion platform with numerous recruitment-related communities (subreddits) including r/recruiting, r/recruitinghell, r/resumes, r/jobs, and industry-specific job boards.

3. **Reputation Monitoring:** Search "ProActive People" to monitor brand mentions
4. **Market Research:** Industry subreddits reveal hiring pain points and trends
