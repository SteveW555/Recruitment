**Competitive Intelligence:**
- **Limited Content Marketing**: Unlike Market Recruitment (URL #150), EMR appears to have minimal thought leadership content on the scraped homepage - suggesting a more transactional/job-board-focused approach

4. **GDPR Compliance as Baseline**: The website's privacy and cookie consent mechanisms highlight that regulatory compliance is non-negotiable in modern recruitment

5. **Niche Overlap Observation**: EMR's focus on marketing/digital/communications overlaps with Market Recruitment's B2B marketing/GTM focus, indicating this talent pool is highly competitive among specialist agencies

6. **Limited Content Scrape**: The minimal content in the scrape could indicate: (a) the site is primarily a job board with content behind login, (b) technical scraping limitations, or (c) the agency relies on job listings rather than thought leadership to attract clients

7. **Technology Stack Investment**: EMR's use of a purpose-built recruitment platform (rather than generic website) shows investment in candidate experience and application management efficiency
