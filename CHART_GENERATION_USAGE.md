## How It Works Now

### Before
```
User: "Show me advertising costs with a bar graph"

User: *Has to create chart manually in Excel*
```

### After
```

## Example Queries That Generate Charts

### Advertising Reports
- "Generate a report on advertising costs over the last year with a bar graph"
- "Show me job board advertising spend trends"
- "Create an advertising cost analysis with visualizations"
- "What did we spend on advertising in 2024?"

**These will automatically generate:**
1. Bar chart - Costs by job board
2. Line chart - Monthly trend
3. Pie chart - Cost distribution

## Adding New Data Sources

2. Add to `self.data_sources` dict:
   ```python
   self.data_sources = {
       'advertising': 'finance_test_data/...csv',
       'placements': 'data/placements.csv',  # NEW
   }
   ```
3. Add detection in `_generate_charts_if_needed()`:
   ```python
   if 'placement' in query_lower:
       # Load placements CSV
       # Generate charts
   ```
