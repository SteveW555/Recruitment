Create `.env` in project root:

```env
# Required
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here

# Optional
BACKEND_PORT=3002
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Agent Routing
```cmd
python test_routing_fix.py
```

All 7 agents should pass classification tests.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Services won't start
1. Check if ports are already in use: `status-check.bat`
2. Stop conflicting services: `stop-all.bat`
3. Check logs in `logs/` directory

### AI Router fails to load
- Ensure Python 3.12+ is installed
- Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements-ai-router.txt`
- Check model cache: `~/.cache/sentence_transformers/`

### Backend can't connect to AI Router
- Ensure AI Router is running: http://localhost:8888/health
- Check environment variables in `.env`
