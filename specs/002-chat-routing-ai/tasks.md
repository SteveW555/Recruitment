**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Completed**: 2025-10-22
**Total Tasks**: 129 (across 9 phases)
**Status**: ✅ 100% COMPLETE
**Implementation Strategy**: MVP-first, incremental delivery by user story

## Implementation Strategy

**MVP Scope** (Week 1-2): User Story 1 + User Story 5 (P1 priorities)
- Core routing infrastructure
- Information Retrieval agent (most common use case)
- Industry Knowledge agent (high-frequency, critical for recruitment)
- Basic testing and validation

**Incremental Delivery** (Weeks 3-6):
- Week 3: User Story 2 & 4 (P2 priorities)
- Week 4: User Story 3 & 6 (P3 priorities)
- Week 5: Integration testing, polish
- Week 6: Load testing, deployment preparation

## User Story Completion Order & Dependencies

```
Phase 1: Setup (No dependencies)
    └─▶ Phase 2: Foundational (Requires Setup)
            ├─▶ Phase 3: User Story 1 [P1] (Information Retrieval) - MVP
            ├─▶ Phase 4: User Story 5 [P1] (Industry Knowledge) - MVP
            ├─▶ Phase 5: User Story 2 [P2] (Problem Solving)
            ├─▶ Phase 6: User Story 4 [P2] (Automation)
