# Phase 4 Implementation - P2 Agents (User Stories 2 & 4)

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
**Date**: 2025-10-22
**Branch**: 002-chat-routing-ai
**Phase**: 4 - User Stories 2 & 4 (High-Value P2 Agents)

## Overview

Successfully implemented the two high-value P2 agents that address strategic and operational automation needs:

1. **ProblemSolvingAgent** - Complex business analysis and recommendations
2. **AutomationAgent** - Workflow pipeline design and specification

Plus comprehensive integration tests validating both agents work correctly with the router.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. ProblemSolvingAgent (`problem_solving_agent.py`)

**Purpose**: Handle complex business problems requiring deep analysis

**Features**:
- Multi-step problem analysis
- Root cause identification
- Industry benchmark cross-referencing (UK recruitment)
- Evidence-based recommendations
- Structured analysis output

**Analysis Framework**:
1. Problem Definition - What is the core issue?
2. Root Cause Analysis - What are underlying factors?
3. Current State Assessment - Compare to industry benchmarks
4. Strategic Recommendations - 3-5 key recommendations
5. Success Metrics - How to measure improvement
6. Implementation Roadmap - Quick wins, phases, long-term

**Industry Benchmarks Included**:
- Placement rate (avg: 65%, high: 80%)
- Time-to-hire (avg: 23 days, varies by role)
- Candidate dropout rate (avg: 25%, acceptable: 20%)
- Client satisfaction (avg: 7.8/10, target: 8.5)
- Fee recovery rate (avg: 92%)
- Salary growth trajectories

**Example Queries Handled**:
- "How can we reduce candidate dropout rate by 20% within 3 months?"
- "Why is our placement rate 15% lower than industry average?"
- "What strategies can improve our time-to-hire for technical roles?"
- "How do we scale our accountancy division without compromising quality?"
- "What's causing the decline in client satisfaction scores?"
- "How can we differentiate from competitors in the Bristol market?"

**Implementation Details**:
- Uses Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Anthropic API)
- 2000 token max output for comprehensive analysis
- System temperature at default for balanced analysis
- Fallback aggregation if API fails
- Includes industry benchmark context in all analyses

### 2. AutomationAgent (`automation_agent.py`)

**Purpose**: Design implementable workflow automation specifications

**Features**:
- Workflow analysis and decomposition
- Trigger, action, and condition specification
- Integration point identification
- Implementability scoring
- Platform recommendations

**Workflow Components Specified**:
- **Trigger(s)** - What event(s) start the workflow
- **Actions** (sequential) - What systems perform each step
- **Decision Points** - Conditional branches
- **Integrations** - System-to-system data flows
- **Error Handling** - Failure scenarios and recovery
- **Success Metrics** - How to measure effectiveness

**Supported Automation Platforms**:
- n8n (open source, self-hosted)
- Zapier (cloud, user-friendly)
- Make (formerly Integromat, powerful)
- Airtable Automations
- Google Sheets Script
- IFTTT
- Native platform scripts

**Workflow Templates Included**:
- Candidate onboarding
- Job posting distribution
- Interview scheduling
- Placement follow-up
- Weekly reporting

**Example Queries Handled**:
- "Every time a new candidate registers, send welcome email, create ATS profile, schedule screening call"
- "I need to automatically notify hiring managers when candidates apply for their jobs"
- "Automate the process of sending interview reminders to candidates"
- "Create a workflow for onboarding new clients"
- "Automate weekly reporting to account managers"
- "Build an automated candidate nurturing sequence"

**Implementation Details**:
- Uses Groq llama-3-70b-8192 for workflow design
- 1000 token output for structured specifications
- Temperature 0.3 for consistent, structured output
- Implementability scoring based on component completeness
- Fallback to basic structure if API fails

## How to Test Phase 4

### Run Integration Tests
```bash
pytest tests/ai_router/integration/test_phase4_agents.py -v
```

### Test Specific Agent
```bash
# Test Problem Solving
pytest tests/ai_router/integration/test_phase4_agents.py::TestUserStory2ProblemSolving -v

# Test Automation
pytest tests/ai_router/integration/test_phase4_agents.py::TestUserStory4Automation -v

# Test Acceptance Criteria
pytest tests/ai_router/integration/test_phase4_agents.py::TestAcceptanceCriteria -v
```

### Test with CLI (with API keys)
```bash
# Set API keys
export GROQ_API_KEY="your-groq-key"
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-anthropic-key"

# Test Problem Solving agent
python -m utils.ai_router.cli "How can we reduce candidate dropout by 20%?"

# Test Automation agent
python -m utils.ai_router.cli "Automate welcome email for new candidates"
```

## Key Design Decisions

### Problem Solving Agent
1. **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**: Superior reasoning for complex analysis
2. **Benchmark Context**: Includes UK recruitment industry benchmarks
3. **Structured Analysis**: Follows clear analysis framework
4. **Evidence-Based**: Grounded in industry data and best practices
5. **Implementable**: Provides actionable recommendations with timelines

### Automation Agent
1. **Groq for Speed**: Fast workflow design iteration
2. **Structured Output**: Templates for triggers, actions, conditions
3. **Platform Agnostic**: Recommendations for multiple platforms
4. **Implementability Scoring**: Confidence in workflow completeness
5. **Error Handling**: Explicit specification of failure scenarios

## Known Limitations

1. **Problem Solving**:
   - Analysis depth depends on Claude API availability
   - Benchmarks are hardcoded (could be made dynamic)

2. **Automation**:
   - Workflows are specifications, not executable code
   - Requires manual implementation in target platform
   - No real-time validation of workflow logic

3. **API Dependencies**:
   - Requires ANTHROPIC_API_KEY for Problem Solving
   - Requires GROQ_API_KEY for Automation
   - Tests work with mocks if keys unavailable

## Next Steps (Phases 5-9)

### Phase 5: Additional Agents
- Implement ReportGenerationAgent (P3)
- Implement DataOperationsAgent (P3)
- Integration testing

### Phase 6: System Optimization
- Load testing with concurrent queries
- Performance tuning
- Cache optimization

### Phases 7-9: Production Deployment
- Monitoring and alerting setup
- Production deployment
- Long-term maintenance and monitoring
