# Implementation Plan: Gmail Email Search & CV Extraction

**Branch**: `004-gmail-email-search` | **Date**: 2025-11-03 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/004-gmail-email-search/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

**Primary Requirement**: Enable recruiters to search their personal Gmail accounts by date range, filter emails by sender/subject/body keywords, and extract/download CV attachments (PDF/DOC/DOCX files) with secure OAuth 2.0 authentication.

**Technical Approach**:
- **Backend**: Node.js/NestJS microservice using Gmail API with OAuth 2.0 authentication
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 React application with server-side rendering for search UI
- **Storage**: PostgreSQL for session management, Redis for OAuth token caching, temporary file system storage for downloaded CVs with 24-hour TTL
- **Integration**: Google Cloud Platform OAuth 2.0 flow, Gmail API v1
- **Security**: Individual user authentication (no shared accounts), encrypted token storage, automatic 24-hour file cleanup

| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
