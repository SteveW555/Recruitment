# Specification Quality Checklist: Staff Specialisations

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-23
**Feature**: [Staff Specialisations Spec](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All items complete

### Validation Notes

- Specification is clear and testable without ambiguity
- 3 user stories with clear priorities (P1, P1, P2)
- 9 functional requirements with measurable success criteria
- 8 measurable outcomes with quantified targets
- 7 assumptions documented to clarify expected behavior
- Edge cases identified for error handling
- Scope boundaries clearly defined

### Ready for Next Phase

This specification is complete and ready for:
- `/speckit.plan` - To create implementation planning artifacts
- `/speckit.clarify` - If additional clarifications are needed before planning
