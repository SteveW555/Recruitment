# Clarification Session Report: Staff Specialisations

**Session Date**: 2025-10-23
**Duration**: 2 questions asked and answered
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

## Summary

All ambiguities in the Staff Specialisations specification have been resolved through a structured clarification session. 2 critical decision points were identified and clarified.

## Clarifications Resolved

### Q1: Case Sensitivity of Staff Role Parameter

**Question**: Should the `staff_role` parameter be case-sensitive when validating against the 5 defined roles?

**Answer**: **Case-sensitive** ✅

**Rationale**:
- Ensures predictable, unambiguous validation behavior
- Prevents confusion from case variants
- Aligns with common API/system parameter best practices
- Clear explicit matching (e.g., `person_1_managing_director` matches, but `Person_1_Managing_Director` does not)

**Spec Impact**:
- Updated Constraints section: "Staff role parameter must match exactly one of the 5 defined roles (case-sensitive)"
- Removed "to be clarified" marker that was in the original spec

---

### Q2: Resource Loading and Prioritization Strategy

**Question**: When multiple resources exist in a staff role directory, how should they be prioritized/ordered when loaded by an agent?

**Answer**: **Agent-driven with optional resources-guide.md** ✅

**Rationale**:
- Delegates prioritization logic to agents (flexibility for intelligent behavior)
- Provides guidance through optional `resources-guide.md` documentation
- Avoids rigid ordering requirements that would be brittle
- Maintains discoverability while allowing agent intelligence

**Spec Impact**:
- Updated User Story 2, Acceptance Scenario 3: Agents consult `resources-guide.md` (if present) to understand resource suitability and make intelligent prioritization decisions
- Added new Functional Requirement FR-010: "System MUST support optional `resources-guide.md` in each staff role directory; agents MUST consult this file (if present) to understand resource suitability and make intelligent prioritization decisions"
- Added Clarifications section documenting both resolutions

   - Clarifies agent's role in intelligent resource prioritization

3. **New Functional Requirement** (FR-010)
   - Specifies system support for optional `resources-guide.md`
   - Defines agent responsibility to consult file if present

### Updated Sections:
1. **Constraints** (line 120)
   - Removed ambiguous "to be clarified" marker

## Readiness Assessment

✅ **Specification is complete and unambiguous**

All critical decision points have been clarified. The specification is now ready for implementation planning with:
- Clear functional requirements (10 total)
- Defined data model (4 entities)
- Measurable success criteria (8 outcomes)
- All edge cases identified
- All assumptions documented
- All constraints specified

**Recommended Next Step**: `/speckit.plan` to generate implementation architecture and tasks.
