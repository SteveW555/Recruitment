# Feature Specification: Staff Specialisations

**Feature Branch**: `003-staff-specialisations`
**Created**: 2025-10-23
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: Staff Specialization agents with role-specific resources

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Query Agent Receives Staff Role Parameter (Priority: P1)

An agent receives a query with an optional `staff_role` parameter that references one of the 5 staff roles defined in the organization structure (Person 1: Managing Director, Person 2: Temp Consultant, Person 3: Resourcer/Admin/Tech, Person 4: Compliance/Wellbeing, Person 5: Finance/Training). The agent can identify which staff role directory contains relevant resources for the query context.

**Why this priority**: This is foundational - without the ability to parse and reference staff roles, the feature cannot function. Every specialized agent execution depends on this.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by passing a staff_role parameter to any agent and verifying it correctly identifies the target staff role without requiring other components.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an agent receives a query with `staff_role="person_1_managing_director"`, **When** the agent initializes, **Then** it identifies the correct staff role and can locate the corresponding resource directory
2. **Given** an agent receives a query without a staff_role parameter, **When** the agent initializes, **Then** it continues operation normally without staff role context
3. **Given** an agent receives a query with an invalid staff_role value, **When** the agent initializes, **Then** it gracefully handles the error and continues without staff role specialization

---

### User Story 2 - Agent Accesses Role-Specific Resources (Priority: P1)

When an agent is assigned a valid staff_role, it can locate and load resources from the corresponding staff role subdirectory (e.g., `Staff Specialisation Resources/person_1_managing_director/`) to enhance its processing. Resources can include guidelines, templates, domain knowledge, or training materials specific to that role's responsibilities.

**Why this priority**: Core functionality - agents must be able to retrieve role-specific resources to provide specialized assistance. This directly enables role-specialized responses.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by placing a sample resource file in a staff role directory and verifying an agent can locate and access it when assigned that role.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an agent has been assigned `staff_role="person_2_temp_consultant"`, **When** the agent searches for resources in that role directory, **Then** it successfully retrieves any resources placed in `Staff Specialisation Resources/person_2_temp_consultant/`
2. **Given** an agent is assigned a staff_role with an empty resource directory, **When** the agent attempts to access resources, **Then** it gracefully handles the empty state and continues operation
3. **Given** an agent is assigned a staff_role and multiple resources exist, **When** the agent loads resources, **Then** all available resources are accessible and the agent can consult `resources-guide.md` (if present) to understand resource suitability and make intelligent prioritization decisions

---

### User Story 3 - Agent Enhances Responses with Role Context (Priority: P2)

When role-specific resources are available, the agent incorporates relevant information from those resources into its response, making recommendations or guidance specific to the assigned staff member's responsibilities, constraints, and domain expertise.

**Why this priority**: This enables the feature's business value - providing role-specialized assistance. However, the system should function without this (Stories 1-2 provide core structure), so it's P2.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating role-specific resources, assigning a staff_role to an agent, and verifying the response incorporates role-relevant information.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an agent has `staff_role="person_1_managing_director"` with available resources, **When** the agent responds to a query, **Then** the response reflects managing director responsibilities (e.g., strategy, key accounts, P&L oversight)
2. **Given** an agent has `staff_role="person_4_compliance_wellbeing"` with available resources, **When** the agent responds to a compliance question, **Then** the response incorporates compliance-specific guidance from available resources
3. **Given** an agent has a staff_role but receives a query outside that role's expertise, **When** the agent responds, **Then** it still provides helpful information while noting any relevant role context

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens if the `staff_role` parameter references a non-existent directory?
- How does the system behave if a resource file is corrupted or unreadable?
- What happens if resources are added/removed while an agent is processing?
- How does the system handle multiple agents accessing the same role resources simultaneously?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST accept an optional `staff_role` parameter on agent queries (valid values: "person_1_managing_director", "person_2_temp_consultant", "person_3_resourcer_admin_tech", "person_4_compliance_wellbeing", "person_5_finance_training")
- **FR-002**: System MUST validate staff_role values against the defined list of 5 roles
- **FR-003**: System MUST locate the corresponding resource directory when a valid staff_role is provided (`Staff Specialisation Resources/{staff_role}/`)
- **FR-004**: System MUST gracefully handle invalid or missing staff_role parameters without failing the query
- **FR-005**: Agents MUST be able to read and parse resources from the assigned staff role directory
- **FR-006**: System MUST support empty staff role directories (directories with no resources yet)
- **FR-007**: Agents MUST incorporate relevant role-specific resources into their responses when available
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain directory structure with 5 staff role subdirectories in `Staff Specialisation Resources/`
- **FR-009**: Agents MUST prioritize role-specific information when available, while maintaining accuracy and relevance
- **FR-010**: System MUST support optional `resources-guide.md` in each staff role directory; agents MUST consult this file (if present) to understand resource suitability and make intelligent prioritization decisions

### Key Entities

- **StaffRole**: Enum with 5 values representing organizational roles (Person 1: Managing Director, Person 2: Temp Consultant & Contact Centre Specialist, Person 3: Resourcer/Admin/Tech, Person 4: Compliance & Wellbeing, Person 5: Finance/Training/Assessment)
- **StaffSpecialisation**: Container for role-specific resources and context, organized by staff role directory
- **AgentQuery**: Extended to include optional `staff_role` parameter
- **AgentResponse**: Enhanced to include optional `staff_role_context` indicating which role context was applied

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 100% of queries with valid staff_role parameters are correctly routed to the corresponding resource directory without errors
- **SC-002**: Agents successfully retrieve and process resources from staff role directories in under 500ms when resources are present
- **SC-003**: System maintains 5 staff role directories with clear, documented naming conventions that match organizational structure
- **SC-004**: Queries without staff_role parameters continue to function normally with no performance degradation
- **SC-005**: Invalid staff_role parameters are handled gracefully without crashing or interrupting service
- **SC-006**: 100% of role-specific resources loaded are relevant to the assigned staff role's responsibilities
- **SC-007**: Agent responses incorporate staff role context when available, improving relevance by at least 20% for role-specific queries (qualitative assessment)
- **SC-008**: Staff role directories remain extensible - new resources can be added without code changes

## Assumptions

1. **Staff roles are static**: The 5 staff roles defined in `docs_project/Domain/STAFF_ROLES_AND_STRUCTURE.md` are the definitive source and will not change frequently
2. **Resources are optional**: Directories can remain empty initially; the system functions normally without resources
3. **Resource format is flexible**: Resources can be in any format (text, markdown, JSON) that agents can parse
4. **No authentication required**: Staff role access doesn't require special permissions - any agent can access any role's resources
5. **Resources are read-only during agent execution**: Agents read but don't modify role-specific resources
6. **Directory structure is stable**: Once created, the `Staff Specialisation Resources/` directory structure persists between deployments
7. **Single staff role per query**: Each agent query is specialized to a single staff role, not multiple roles

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-23

- **Q1: Case Sensitivity of Staff Role Parameter** → **A: Case-sensitive** - Staff role values must match exactly (e.g., `person_1_managing_director`). This ensures predictable, unambiguous validation behavior.

- **Q2: Resource Loading and Prioritization Strategy** → **A: Agent-driven with resources-guide.md** - When multiple resources exist in a staff role directory, agents load all available resources and consult an optional `resources-guide.md` document (if present) to intelligently assess suitability and prioritization. This delegates prioritization logic to the agent while providing guidance through documentation.

## Constraints

- Staff role parameter must match exactly one of the 5 defined roles (case-sensitive)
- Directory paths must be relative to project root or clearly documented base path
- System must support concurrent access from multiple agents without data corruption
- Resource loading must not impact agent response latency (target: <500ms additional latency)

## Scope Boundaries

**In Scope**:
- Creating and managing the `Staff Specialisation Resources/` directory structure
- Accepting and validating `staff_role` parameter
- Loading resources from role directories
- Integrating role context into agent responses

**Out of Scope**:
- Creating initial resources (will be added later)
- Resource content validation or quality control
- User interface for managing resources
- Resource versioning or history tracking
- Role-based access control for resources
